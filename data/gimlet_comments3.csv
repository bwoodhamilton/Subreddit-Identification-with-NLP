jonny_lube,"Agreed.  I did a cursory Google to learn more, and it barely scratched the surface.  While Momo seems mostly like an urban legend and a most day Candyman, the reason it's believable is that there was a Russian internet ""challenge"" that actually did lead to a rash of suicides. It wasn't just a dark roleplay gone too far or reckless trolling either.  People went to jail and admitted that the intent was actually to cull those they thought were mentally weak.  
  
  There is a greater story of online manipulation through gamification targeting teens that coerce for different endgames.  It's an effective manipulation tactic that will continue to arise.  
  
  I understand not wanting to perpetuate a panic, or go too dark and cynical.  It's not quite on brand for the pod.  But either talk about it for real or don't talk about it at all.  While entertaining, this story was kind of worthless at best and dangerous at worst.

Hell I listen to a podcast on urban planning, I don't URBAN PLAN.

Things I hope this ""bubble"" will approach:

* **Discoverability** - often I'll only hear of good podcasts through; other die hard podcasting peers, podcast referencing another podcast (often seen in comedian podcasts or conglomerates (obviously)) or searching - how I found Bald Move's TV series podcasts (GoT, WestWorld).

* **Shareability** - as much as I want to see this addressed, consuming audio content is inherently an alone type thing. Sure you can listen together (as I have, ala old time radio shows) but I typically only find myself doing that with significant others. Similarly sharing snippets of audio is not a thing on most podcast platforms - and there is zero context other than what you provide. I think NPR's podcast app tried to address this - don't know though not interested in a singular genre podcast app.

* Machine learning podcast notes. Currently [podcastnotes.org](https://podcastnotes.org/) has volunteers scribing and gathering resource links - for only a select few podcasts. Would love to see machine learning pull that audio data into text, organize it in such a way that recognizes; books, websites, quotes and more. I know this is a big ask lol thinking long term here.

bitica,"Longest Shortest Time just did an episode about this - a woman in her 60s discovering she was conceived via sperm donor, and the man who raised her was not her biological father. So as someone else said, I think this is common enough now that Reply All wouldn't necessarily have a new angle on it.

What I think would be a new angle is the increasing use of these tests and other information by both donor conceived people and ""recipient parents"" (the term for people who use donor sperm/egg/embryos to conceive their kids) to proactively identify their donors. I know recipient parents who, before even selecting a donor, have been able to identify his exact identity based on clues dropped in his sperm bank profile. Others have found the donor later via DNA test/genealogical sleuthing. (One person was recently hit by sanctions from her sperm bank by doing this for her 5 year old daughter.) These donors have been/are promised anonymity by the banks (or sometimes anonymity until the kids turn 18), and this is just no longer possible and is deceptive on the part of the banks. The banks sometimes put clauses into their contracts that the recipient family won't try to identify the donor/reach out to the donor or their family, but the donor conceived people themselves aren't bound by this agreement because you can't sign a contract on behalf of a person who wasn't even conceived yet. So once they're old enough to explore on their own, they can and often will do so. I think within a couple decades everyone will understand the impossibility of donor anonymity, but we're not quite at that tipping point yet.",1552755562,gimlet

ExternalTangents,"I know someone who is in her 60s, both of her parents died 20+ years ago. She's always been interested in her ancestry and heritage, including doing research on ancestry records at Ellis Island. So for Christmas a couple years ago, her kids got her an ancestry kit. And knew her mom came from Italian immigrants in both sides, and that her dad was fully from the British Isles.

But her DNA results came back as more than 75% Italian. She had no immediate idea where the extra Italian background came from, and very few leads. Was her dad's heritage incorrect?

So she started by getting her siblings to do the DNA test. Their results came back as 50% Italian, which seemed to give the answer--the man who raised her wasn't her biological father. She asked around the few remaining relatives on her mom's side from her mom's generation, but nobody had any answers. It seemed like the mystery would end there.

*after the break: the mystery did not end there*

&lt;ad break&gt;

She tried two additional online DNA services, and, thanks to one of them, found two other women roughly her age who matched as half sisters. And those two women had only just recently found out about each other. So now we have three strangers who are all finding out they're related by one parent.

The three of them met up in the town where their moms lived, and worked together to piece together what happened. Apparently their mom's were all friends who worked as switchboard operators for the same air force base. 

Long story short (there are a couple more twists along the way) they find out that their mutual biological father (who raised one of the women) was a suave ladies man in his day, and who, at age 96, is still alive. He says he had no idea about either of the daughters with women he didn't marry, but he's glad to meet them and also willing to do a DNA test to verify their relationship.

""Belling the Cat"" is a fable also known under the titles ""The Bell and the Cat"" and ""The Mice in Council"". Although often attributed to Aesop, it was not recorded before the Middle Ages and has been confused with the quite different fable of Classical origin titled The Cat and the Mice. In the classificatory system established for the fables by B. E. Perry, it is numbered 613, which is reserved for Mediaeval attributions outside the Aesopic canon.

asuka_is_my_co-pilot,"One thing that I had hoped they'd touch on, which really is just a theory of mine, but monsters that grow popular are usually an allusion or reflection on the general fears of the culture at the time.

Not always a 1:1 allegory (ty Lindsey Ellis) and not always intentional, but it happens.

I think the fear of like they said not being in control of what kids see, and people intentionally trying to scare kids to laugh at the parents is legitimate, but I think there's also a huge fear of not taking care do your childrens mental health.

That poor mental health leading to suicides of people younger and younger. I think people are genuinely scared of suicide in a way that we never were before.

I've heard of kids younger than 10 killing themselves over bullying or mental illnesses. And it's terrifying.. It's so easy to overlook the pain that even kids can feel, and scary to think you might miss that.

I think that's another reason momo has gotten so popular (which is weird cause she's a reallllly old creepy pasta lol) but, I think shes a personification of what used to be ""an old man meeting teens online"" has now become ""bulliied by classmates online"" or ""being taken in by a toxic community online"" ",1552669003,gimlet

The scary thing about this is not that Momo could be sending suicide instructions to your three year old via Whatsapp (because come on), it's that people with bad intentions are sneaking disturbing content into your young child's content, and it's coming through an app that promised to curate safe content for children specifically. This episode didn't do a good job at communicating that idea, but I think that's what they were going for. 

Unfortunately, the way this was covered didn't do justice to the larger questions behind the scandals: How can parents keep their kids shielded from genuinely fucked-up content when digital entertainment is the norm? When Google labels an app specifically for kids, what extra responsibilities are they taking on? When content like this does beat the system, what expectations should be placed on Google and/or on parents to address the damage done?

Filthy Frank is/was an ""edgy"" internet persona of one guy who's had a truly bizarre effect on the internet as a whole, even if most of it is annoying and gross.

Then [someone edited him into a video that showed up on YouTube Kids](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/trolls-youtube-kids-shows-self-harm-clip).

I'm certainly not a fan of his, but he's not the first, or even second or third, party I'd be mad at when the issue at hand is this content getting onto YouTube Kids.

That part is kind of an across the board critique of reply all, which is weird considering they do Y/Y/N so well and go into such specific detail, while here they don’t mention that it’s Filthy Frank in the video, barely describe the extent to what “Kids YouTube” is/was, like sometimes when they explain Online shit it seems like they leave just enough information out for the lay-person to kind of understand the subject but still leave it obfuscated enough as a subject that it feels mysterious.

* Momo has been around for a long time as a harmless copypasta, primarily in South America, and it has only recently resurfaced to scare parents.
* ""The man"" that was spliced into one kid's video telling people to kill themselves was Filthy Frank, aka Joji aka George Miller. (Co-incidentally, also was responsible for starting the Harlem Shake meme) and to call the news articles that were written about this as valid is still misleading, as it was only one video, and most kids know who this figure is. 
* \#Elsagate occurred over a year ago and has been (mostly) dealt with. The pedophile ring (known as  ADpocalypse 2.0 for the fact many companies have pulled advertising over this discovery) is far more recent, and has been discovered  by a man named Matt Watson.

Now sure, it gets inconvenient AF, especially if you live in a rural area. But that is mostly in regards to going out to eat and close minded friends/family. And if you are talking about expense, going out shouldn't be a common occurrence anyway.

So I don’t think it’s grifters that they worry about in the Democratic Party so much as “Fifth Columnists” and “Manchuria Candidates”. 

On the other side, the Left like Chapo makes fun of the “lanyard” crowd. Washington insiders who think they can just policy their way of political problems. Or the Pod Save America Obama bros are, to them, essentially in the same crowd. A different kind of sycophantism, in their eyes, one that is very wonky, navel-gazing, inside the Beltway, quick to compromise, and detached from any real political fight. It’s not the place where you’d exactly expect strong personalities to emerge from. Chapo Trap House make fun of the weird loyalty many felt for the Clintons. Whereas Obama was willing even to deny his own minister, the Clintons have acquired a coterie of really odd people in their orbit. The most memorable names might be like Peter Douad who most people have never heard of (Douad is interesting because I was introduced to him on Chapo as a tragic figure but in the last year or so, he’s started sounding like a relatively radical Sanders supporter on Twitter so has found something of a redemption arc), but if Clinton had won, he’d probably have Sebastian Gorka levels of fame.

They actually ask the first question at his press conference because they’re very committed to making fun of him, but also grudgingly respect his grift. 

The Weeds, though, has a more surprising take. Chapo is the official podcast of the “dirtbag left” while the Weeds is meant to be the more serious left-liberal policy program so I expect Chapo to be more irreverent and radical.

GIMLET STAFF VOTES TO UNIONIZE

I’ve heard rumblings about this for a while, but it’s officially happening: Gimlet Media’s 80-plus-person staff announced Wednesday morning that they are unionizing with the Writers’ Guild of America. Notably, the announcement comes about a month after Spotify’s blockbuster acquisition of Gimlet for $230 million.

BuzzFeed News’ Caroline O’Donovan published the first story on the matter this morning:

&gt;Among the issues Gimlet’s union says it plans to focus on are fair treatment of contractors, workplace diversity, employee intellectual property, and transparency around pay, promotions, and terminations.

&gt;Employees, 75% of whom signed union cards in support of the organizing campaign, are asking management to voluntarily recognize their unintuitive, which they say will include content creation roles such as producers, engineers, reporters, and hosts on both the branded and editorial sides of the company. The union will not include managers or sales and marketing staff.

O’Donovan also points out that this is the first podcasting company to join the WGA.

Rachel Ward, a member of Gimlet’s union organizing committee, tells me that organizing efforts began in earnest around November. The move was partly informed by the broader movement of unionization that’s been taking place across digital media — which includes efforts by editorial staffs at Vice Media, The New Yorker, HuffPost, and New York Magazine — but was also catalyzed as a response to specific concerns about the Brooklyn podcast company. These concerns include having clearer rules around advancement, having more transparent and equitable salary bands, and providing better benefits to contractors.  

Ward also tells me that Gimlet leadership had generally been responsive to requests for improvements in the past, and that this unionization effort was largely motivated by a need for the editorial team to formalize a unified voice within the company.

The organizing effort was voluntarily put on hold in January, when staffers began hearing talk of an acquisition by Spotify. “During that time, we decided to put a pause on recognition, because we weren’t really sure what was going to happen and wanted to let the water settle around the Spotify deal,” Ward said. With the acquisition now finalized, the committee resumed their campaign on Monday, when they sent a formal recognition request to Gimlet management.

Gimlet leadership, along with their new overseers at Spotify, now find themselves in a fascinating and perhaps sensitive situation. At this point in time, it isn’t clear to me whether Spotify was aware of the organizing effort during the acquisition talks, and in the case that they weren’t, whether the outcome would have been the same if they were to learn about the effort. (Spotify did not respond to BuzzFeed’s request for comment by the time of publication, and I haven’t gotten a response to my own request at this writing either.) As I constantly noted during February’s news barrage, this is the first time that Spotify has acquired a straight-up content company — and one with a sizable workforce, at that. I’m wont to argue that the ingestion of Gimlet additionally exposes the Swedish streaming platform to the dynamics and politics of a part of the digital media ecosystem that they’ve not quite accustomed to before. Which brings us to the complex historical significance of this development: Spotify is now both a technology and an media-editorial company; in its handling of this move to unionize, which will it more resemble? (As Fast Company points out, no organizing efforts at a major technology company have been successful so far.)

What happens next will set the tone for the rest of the podcast industry. The Gimlet employee union is looking to be voluntarily recognized, which hasn’t always been smooth in other digital media unionizing efforts. Should Gimlet management voluntarily recognize the effort, it could create a permission structure that sparks a similar drive in other podcasting outlets. If they do not, it would likely introduce a layer of friction and complication not only among the Gimlet rank-and-file, but among editorial podcast teams within other publishers that will be watching this development closely.

To be clear on The Nod, which I dip in and out of week-to-week: Its definitely about race and particularly Blackness, but I really like the cultural spin and hardcore blerd bent they take.

guitarnoir,"I'm glad it was you who took the hit on this because I just started listening, and my ears went up when I heard Nigeria.

So, since I'm already here, let me just say that I don't really watch television. It's not that I have anything against TV, it has more to do with my lifestyle. In any case, I did binge the first season and a half of ""The Good Place"", just the other day (I was bed ridden with an illness).

I basically liked the show, but as I was watching the first season I found myself wondering how long they could keep on with the main character's deceptions before it became tedious. I was very glad when other layers were revealed at the end of the first season.

So, I'm halfway through season two, and I'm find it hard to imagine that the story could be sustained through three seasons. I guess what I'm hoping for is someone to tell me that it's worth my non-bed ridden time to view all the shows? (thanks in advance for your answers).

As to The Nod's coverage of this show, I must say that I've never listened to The Nod, and I'm your average older white guy. The only thing that brought me to The Nod was this particular show's subject.

One thing I like about TGP is that race seems to a ""been there, done that"" kind of thing in the afterlife. We're dead now, so that's not really relevant here.

Like when Chidi is speaking with Tahani in a ""getting to know you"" manner and she ask about how he likes the French. He says something like, ""Well they did kill or enslave a third of my country, so I'm not a big fan. But they do have nice museums"".

There's almost a clinical distance from life on Earth that makes Race mute. I don't know, maybe I'm just seeing what a average white dude wants too see when it comes to the question of Race. 

So now I'll go back and listen to the rest of The Nod to perhaps have the scales lifted from my eyes, and finally be able to see how Race really is a active subject in the afterlife as it is depicted in The Good Place (shout-out to /u/csl512 and /u/fartonme in the hopes of getting their opinion on whether I should view all the shows).

investors are so right. say i want to fly philly to denver. great! $75. but wait, i've got to pay $200/mo. but wait, that's only for one way ticket. give me another $75 for way back. $350 for RT.

Google flights has my RT at $157-$200 (so probably closer to $200-$250 after tax and stuff).

So for someone travelling once a month it doesn't make sense.

But here's the thing, if I start travelling twice a month, they're just going to break even or even start losing money. And that'd be the only reason most would rationally sign up. To travel &gt;1/mo.

After the first year or so, on paper I received a $40 dividend, so the cost basis is considered $2,040.  However, I've received no paperwork showing the breakdown or what fees were associated with it. 

To that end, Alphaworks and its various managing companies they've gone through have been terrible in their paperwork; continually late on receiving K-1s, etc.  Last April I asked where it was for 2017 and was told there was no taxable activity, so one wouldn't be issued.

bdawghoya28,"The problem is...he kept discussing how he's an expert in the field, but actually doesn't have a firm grasp on how the airline industry and revenue management work.

As someone who has actually worked in the space, he's wrong about the following:

1. Airline executives do not care only about load factor. In fact, since demand is so high and capacity has been constrained, people care far more about yield (call it an average fare metric) and he's proposing a product that drives this down.
2. He believes that once a flight reaches a breakeven load factor that an airline will take any amount of money for the next ticket sale. Actually, a flight reaches breakeven load factor on the leisure travelers that his product targets. Once it reaches that point, airlines want to move fares higher and higher because it is the business/price insensitive traveler that is booking.
3. Airlines already have channels for getting rid of distressed demand. Priceline and Hotwire have ""Express Deals"" that represent the lowest an airline is willing to go and remove the option of picking the airline and the schedule so the airline's brand isn't perceived as being ""discounted"".
4. If an airline wants to go very low, they are have their own flash sale type options. JetBlue does this usually twice a month. The options aren't great....you get Tuesday 5am or Saturday 9pm options or markets like JFK-Syracuse that this founder's target market doesn't want.

Generally I was cringing and screaming at the podcast the entire time because he doesn't understand the market he's trying to ""disrupt"". The investors were right on the airline economics side of this one...I was praying none of them would be silly enough to invest.",1552065263,gimlet

ManitouWakinyan,"I came into this episode being really mad about what a jerk the investor was being in the cold open, and really turning around by the end. I was sitting there thinking if if the entrepreneurs next words aren't MoviePass and Amazon prime are fundamentally different, he was making a huge mistake. But then I realized that the investor is actually right. This is more like MoviePass, because you have customers who are either going to use the system to its limit, in which case you no longer profitable, or you have consumers who won't, and the leaf. and so at the end of the day all that you're left with is the customers who are a drain on your bottom line.

now, what AMC and Amazon have in common is that their subscription models don't actually cost them all that much. It cost them a loss in revenue, in that AMC is no longer getting that individual ticket sale, or Amazon is no longer getting the up charge for delivery, but there are a ton of tangential benefits that movie pass or this business can't enjoy. So for instance, AMC users tend to bring friends and family to the movies with them. So you get a ton of following tickets from non-subscribers. So if I get to my buddies to go to the movie with me, AMC is making ten bucks more than they would have otherwise. If I just bring my wife with me oh, they're breaking even. So this gives them more opportunities to break even then they'd otherwise get. And then the other benefit is that AMC users buy more in concessions, so you're potentially making up the Lost revenue from the ticket they are as well. So basically you have at least two new funding streams that help compensate 4 the potential loss. And the loss is reduced because it's not actually you paying another business as much of his is an opportunity cost issue, and you may not have gotten the revenue from that ticket anyways if the user wasn't a subscriber. It seems like a little difference but those are really crucial as you add them up and figure out what your overall revenue is going to be, and if it's even possible to make a profitable in the long term.",1551999154,gimlet

CozyAmigo,"&gt;Regardless, my main point is that it's not CREDIBLE to claim the model is different from MoviePass and more like Amazon Prime and so you have NO CHOICE but to lean into the comparison.

I definitely agree with this. The Amazon prime comparison doesn't work and so he really needs a defence for why even though it doesn't work for movies it could work for air travel. Your point about people not wanting to be tied to a single airline is a good one. I think he was right to look into deals with airlines, if he can get some of those agreed  he might be able to pitch better unit economics but I'm skeptical. I wonder why he doesn't just cap the number of flights at his break even point (I think he said 3 a month). At least that way none of his customers will lose him money but I guess maybe he thinks it wouldn't be as attractive to customers",1551892755,gimlet
mike____,"&gt; I actually think what you've said about movie pass confirms the investors point more than disproves it.

Well, but then you just argue that the airline industry is different only in the good ways -- that people don't want to be restricted to one airline, but only really use one movie theater regularly, for example. And that that's the reason for a middleman.

Regardless, my main point is that it's not CREDIBLE to claim the model is different from MoviePass so you have NO CHOICE but to lean into the comparison.",1551890543,gimlet
mike____,I agree that is the only way we will know for sure.,1551890240,gimlet
CozyAmigo,"When I heard the start of the pitch I started thinking of Hotels Tonight, which lets hotels sell of vacant rooms at the last minute. I doubt there would enough of a market in people who pack their bags and are looking for random flights the day of. Considering how long people normally spend planning trips I don't it's too disengenious to call  within 10 days last minute but if that's the way people are starting to book anyway he doesn't have much of a point of difference. The issue is that it's only cheaper for the power users but they break his business model and he needs deals with airlines to even have a chance.

I actual ly think what you've said about movie pass confirms the investors point more than disproves it. MoviePass loses tons of money because it's a middle man that needs underutilisation to be profitable. However cinema chains can use to this model to proitably take advantage of their spare capacity. In the UK several cinema chains have had unlimited passes for years. The investors actually made this point that airlines could just do this themselves. This model can be profitable if it is direct to consumer but there does not seem to be enough margin for a middle man to be profitable. 

I think the best thing about the business is that it massively simplfies the process of buying tickets. Using price comparison sites can be extremely frustrating at times and a fixed price based on milleage is appealing but probably not enough to pay such a high monthly subscription.

Interestingly I've seen another similar startup on facebook claiming to be the Netflix of travel. You pay a monthly fee and can travel a set number of times per year (6 I think) but can't pick the destination (you can say where you don't want to go). It's aimed more at a flexible person who wants to travel cheaply and explore new places much like the people who just hang around the airport waiting for a flight to wherever. Which I think is the most likely market for this kind of service.",1551887745,gimlet
CozyAmigo,"Podcast Ad revenue is still relatively tiny compared to other forms of advertising so there's  a very good chance that even with it's popularity the show would not be profitable at such a low output. Also it's very important to distinguish between slow to produce and zero production for over a year with no sign of any new content on the horizon. A show can't be profitable if it produces nothing. If the show was slightly profitable or even break even and Starlee was able to produce at least 6 episodes a year it would not have been cancelled. Gimlet achieved said growth by launching new shows and has shows that are quick to produce, slow to produce and one off seasons. But you can't keep paying staff costs for a producer who makes no content. I doubt it has anything to do with Gimlet being VC backed in fact I'm pretty sure if Gimlet hadn't been VC backed it would never have been able to meet the production costs of a podcast like Mystery Show in the first place. Based on her twitter she has been passed on by pretty much every podcast network out there because they think the budget she is asking for is too high. The idea that all these networks including new ones that could use a proven hit to establish themselves tells you something about the shows viability. The only way we will know for sure is if she crowdfunds, then we can see how much she asks for and how much content actually gets produced for that money.   ",1551885934,gimlet

mike____,"I'm not convinced her show isn't financially viable. I think what likely happened is that the show was so popular that it would still make money despite being expensive and slow to produce, but that Gimlet's short-term goal was to be acquired for the highest possible amount.

And so a slightly profitable slow-to-produce popular show would only lower their valuation. They needed to show GROWTH!",1551882714,gimlet
mike____,"First, I really liked the CEO. What I didn't love about the product was that it was a little bit of a bait and switch. It was pitched at first as they sell last-minute tickets, and he used the example of people at the airport trying to use what doesn't get sold.

But then he explained it was the last 10 days and that increasingly the trend is towards more and more flights being sold in the last two weeks. So if that's the case, the product isn't about last-minute flights at all. It's early and the product isn't what it'll eventually be, but at the very least I don't think this was explained well.

I think the hate on the MoviePass model went way too far by investors. It's worth noting that in response to MoviePass, AMC and others are now implementing their own versions of it because they find the model profitable if they aren't so generous with it. So even though MoviePass is likely to have failed very publicly, there was a real innovation and market need that was identified and is profitable. Whether that applies to airlines, too, is less clear but that's the gamble of investing.

GuniBulls,"Just an FYI on the NBA stuff:

As a die hard NBA fan, and to be clear not a knicks fan, there's a lot more nuance to the knicks move then just moving Porzingis salary. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Porzingis suffered a very very serious injury last season, and will probably not play this season. Questions on his long term health are fair. He is a unicorn after all (very big and athletic)
2. Porzingis actually didn't carry a big salary. But the knicks almost moved about 100m of salary in other players as part of this deal.
3. They got back a very good young player in Dennis Smith Jr. (who's only in his second year) plus they also acquired 2 future first round picks (which are very valuable)
4. This is a huge year with a number of big free agents available. Including Kevin Durant (top 5), Kyrie Irving (Top 10) and Jimmy Butler (top 20). There has been a lot of rumours about collusion this year, which sucks, but it's possible the knicks have a verbal agreement of 2 star players. This move on salary cap affords them the opportunity to sign 2, which may have been a requirement from one of these players.
5. Players don't care about James Dolan nearly as much as people think. Playing in New York is a big dream for many players and it affords them great marketing opportunities. The most important thing players really want these days is to play with other great players in a big city. (see point 4 about space for 2 star players).

&amp;#x200B;

So whilst this episode wanted to play this particular move by the knicks as 'crazy / laughable', there's actually a lot of reason behind it. Even in this episode you see the uneducated fans hate on any move a team makes, as was the case when they selected Porzingis which turned out to be an amazing draft selection. The knicks are not without their faults. I know first hand as a bulls fan we benefited a lot from some of their moves in the past :) but this particular move could really elevate this team for the future.",1551750679,gimlet

At those places, fresh fruits and veggies are few and far between and a lot more expensive than what you see in the super market.

So I can totally understand how you get this feeling for YYN, because I have the same reaction for the opposite reason for other episodes.

Sometimes to me it feels like Reply All should be several different shows. At the same time I’m not sure, because I think this sweet and savoury mix is part what makes the show special. I imagine they have thought about this.

Createplaycomplain,"I agree with Michael that the pitch, as originally presented, did not make sense. Here's the beginning of the founder's pitch:

""I'd like you guys to think about the closest relationships in your life--your family, your friends, your significant others--and imagine that they only showed you appreciation just once a year, or maybe it was a couple times a year but it was always the same thing like Happy Hour at Applebee's. I don't want that. I don't think you guys want that. So why is that the standard we have for companies and employees?

Companies are struggling to connect with and maintain Millennial talent. In that effort, they're trying to create experiences.That's where CultureForce comes in. We've created an online platform where companies can go to find engaging and unique events and activities to help meet the needs of their employees and increase retention.""

So in the first paragraph, the founder is setting up the problem that companies rely on dumb events once or twice a year to show employee appreciation, instead of building up the kind of respectful relationship and meaningful engagement that's necessary for employees to feel appreciated.

Because of this problem, Millennial employees leave. So how can CultureForce help fix this? By helping companies switch their once- or twice-yearly ""employee appreciation"" events to activities that might or might not be slightly cooler. Instead of Happy Hour once a year, let's fly a drone once a year!  Even though the founder denigrated the swoop-in-once-a-year approach to relationship-building in the start of his pitch, he's built his whole business on that approach. The pitch contradicts itself within the first two minutes.

Then he has fully-grown venture capitalists glue googly eyes to popsicle sticks as a taste of the kind of meaningful activities his company can coordinate. He didn't think that was infantilizing? Do you want to make popsicle-stick robots as part of an employee appreciation event? I do not. Maybe someone does, but you're alienating as many people as you're engaging.

The whole thing seems like a parody, not a venture-scale business.

However, if you pitch a marketplace that raises visibility and streamlines payments for vendors of corporate events--that actually sounds like a business. Possibly even a venture-scale one. That was excellent advice given by the investors.

So,  maybe it got better, but I think it's not getting the attention people here think it should because the beginning was pretty weak. ",1551299933,gimlet

disgracetomylivery,"I liked it. It also seemed like quite a production - more than a year following Manny around. It should be getting more attention. The storytelling and production are pretty good. I don't think it's as compelling as Serial Season 3 or S-town, which might explain why it's sort of overlooked. 

As for the content: &gt;!Although Manny isn't as violent or transgressive as the police are portrayed, but the whole William Stevens/Stephen Williams claims of him falsely testifying against +25 suspects points something potentially really troubling. That is, Manny's tactics and desire to ""take down"" the police is a bad combination could make Manny almost as bad as the system he's trying to fight. That said though, there didn't seem to be much question that there didn't seem to be much evidence that Hernandez was the shooter.!&lt;

Also I hate they way the ads are now placed in the middle of the pitch vs before when it was after the pitch was over and before the followup.

Our system is so broken. 

Even for the people out there who won't admit that racist policies and racist cops are treating POC unfairly, the show highlights some of the issues at Riker's (like the delays / improbability of getting a trial at all, let alone a speedy one) in a way that's undeniable.

Manny was not a hero. That hero doesn't exist and shouldn't have to. He did attempt to be a wrench in a fucked up system, even if he did it for all of the wrong reasons. But holy shit some seriously fucked up shit is going on with that particular cop and a great number of cops. ",1551260504,gimlet
7DeadlyFins,"I really enjoyed the show, and the story telling was great... But I gotta be honest I didn't buy into the social justice/victim aspect as much as was being sold on the show.

Had they not been troublemakers to begin with, its unlikely they would have been in that position. 

&amp;#x200B;

Manny... Manny is the type of person who should never be given a platform for his dangerous voice. He drew black and white conclusions that fit his narrative from miniscule shreds of ""evidence"". that isn't the type of person who should have any responsibility or leadership in my opinion.

I think it's entirely **possible** that even though the show failed to produce second season episodes and was incredibly expensive that Gimlet made the wrong decision in firing her. Not an ""evil"" decision, but a possibly-incorrect one given the success of the first season.

The truth is, we don't know. In the absence of all the inside numbers, people here tend to trust those who actually know the numbers and are stuck with payroll -- a perfectly fair thing to do! And while I think that's generally a good instinct, I do think people can take that too far and assume that management doesn't make bad decisions, often based on short-term thinking. I know I see that at the various places I've worked, and I bet many of you could say the same where you work.

The other thing is some people might conclude from her tweets that she may be more trouble than she's worth. But I think it can be really healthy to a company to have people who can be frustrating to work with because they're passionately arguing for things that they believe in. They shouldn't win every fight, but for example her rants about advertisers are reflecting something in the real world that some listeners care about and making decisions being blind to that is a bad thing.

So yeah, Gimlet management knows more than us about what the situation was. But one MORE reason not to take it out on Starlee not mentioned above is that we shouldn't assume that she was wrong to begin with. Defer judgment but assume good faith on all sides.",1550611267,gimlet

Sources close to Le Roux describe the divorce as ""violent"",[5] while another states the couple parted ways amicably.[6] It is unclear whether the couple had any children – some sources mention a son[5][8] while others claim Le Roux's first child (a son) was with his second wife.

&gt;Between 2000 and 2001, Le Roux married a Dutch citizen named Lilian Cheung Yuen Pui. The couple had a son soon after.[5][6] She appears to have been involved in his business, managing some of his assets, until Le Roux's arrest.[18]

&gt;Around 2007, Le Roux began a relationship with Cindy Cayanan, a Filipina citizen.[1] In September 2007, he relocated his family to Manila. The couple have a daughter, born around 2007. Despite Le Roux claiming Cayanan as his wife on at least one occasion, his marriage to Pui was never dissolved and he stayed in contact with her until his arrest. A ""newborn son"" is also mentioned in 2012, but it is unclear whether the mother is Cayanan or Le Roux's Brazilian mistress.[18]

Hence calling Afrikaans a dead language is an opinion, a use of imagery to describe one’s subjective view on the language. It doesn’t make sense for the reporter to randomly insert his own subjective opinion about something like this in a place like that in the story, especially without any markers that it is his opinion like “I think”, hence the reporter has to be paraphrasing someone else.)

tmcdonal,"I made a small investment at the time - $2k.  As I recall, it was a round offering $250k.  Since then, I've vacillated between why i didn't go up to something more like $10k, to wondering how I would ever get my money back.

In September, 2018, Matt sent out an lengthy update on all things good and bad.  He had this line in there ""We’re moving away from a world where all podcasts are available for free everywhere, via RSS.  And toward a world where platforms are competing for exclusive content. Much like video- where if you want to watch Jack Ryan you go to Amazon, and if you want to watch Ozark you go to Netflix."" 

I sent a reply stating that I prefer to have control of podcasts to speed up playback and skip forwards and backwards.  I would not support an exclusive move to something like Apple.  I also suggested they change their paid membership model to offer commercial free RSS feeds of their shows.  In the same way that I support NPR, This American Life, etc., that sort of membership would offer great value.

I didn't expect a reply, but Matt emailed back shortly after that they are looking to revamp the membership model (no specifics) and that it was likely that the overall landscape is for podcasts to shift to platforms, with or without Gimlet.  There was never any indication the Spotify move.

On Feb 6, 2019, I got an email labeled ""Strictly Private and Confidential."" There was little news that hasn't been published in the media, but not going to quote anything.  It said I would be receiving info soon on how to receive funds.

Keep in mind she was the one investor who didn’t seem to be following along. In a “wait did she really just say that moment”, she actually asked him to explain his algorithm! Huh?!? It had already clearly been established that it was certain bettors using algorithms to game the system she invested in.

I mean, it's moot here because it's a bad investment for broad reasons we've discussed AND the specific reasons mentioned in the pitch. But stepping away, sometimes good companies have founders who give a bad pitch. Sure, they aren't UNRELATED. A good company makes for a much better pitch and good CEOs communicate effectively.

The pitch was muddled. The other reason I say it was clearly implied was that the nature of all the questions was along the lines of ""how are you going to acquire a large user base"", ""how are you  going defend against established companies"", ""how are you going to do what draft kings did with so little money"". Anyone with business acumen can see that those questions are asking how do you become a big venture scale company. Even if he didn't get this, he still needed to answer the questions in a clear manner. He just gave really bad muddled answers. I didn't even realise that he only wanted to be a modest company until the interview afterwards. He wasn't clear in the room. Also I think the investors did their job perfectly well. Their job is to determine if something can be a venture scale opportunity and to ask questions that help them reach that conclusion. They asked the right questions to determine that this was a bad investment opportunity therefore not losing a ton of money as you put it.

This is something I've noticed in these pitches and those of Shark Tank. Sometimes investors will describe Founder X as ""defensive"" or arrogant, for example, but they will applaud Founder Z for defending their company and their business models, etc. 

I think, if you were to take both founders out of context (with regards to the VC's in the room and wherever their conversations might have taken them) and listen to their pitches and responses without that weird chemistry in the room I'm sure they would sound exactly the same. 

I feel this might be due to the chemistry between VCs and Founders (obviously an important part of this relationship) but I think it might also be VCs projecting onto founders (like in the case of this pitch).

You can say the same about some reply all episodes but they have a varied format to fill the gaps. Yes Yes Nos and stories about past events where they already know the outcome. Every episode of mystery show was like super tech support or the indian call center eps with no way to make it more manageable",1550019734,gimlet
CozyAmigo,Seems like she had over 6 months possibly closer to a year for season 2. There was no output. You can't pay salaries for that long and get nothing. Unless Gimlet actually charged for the episodes (like buying songs on itunes) it was probably never going to make enough money to justify the expense. ,1550018768,gimlet
CozyAmigo,Well it was cancelled but neither gimlet or starlee could make anymore without buying the other out. Both expressed interest in letting Starlee buy the rights but a deal was never reached. Hence limbo is pretty accurate. Now all of a sudden years later a company was going to help Starlee revive it only to be spooked at the last minute by the spotify deal. Seems like a convenient exscuse,1550018249,gimlet
CozyAmigo,She writes for the TV show search party and seems to be doing voice acting for the podcast adventures in New America,1550018005,gimlet
orisonofjmo,Looooooooooooool,1550017633,gimlet
CozyAmigo,"On twitter she has said she wants to go the rebrand route and not give gimlet anymore money but she is also saying she may not be emotionally up making a show again. it's been years, how emotionally unstable is she if getting a show cancelled scars her for life? ",1550017224,gimlet
CozyAmigo,"I wonder how true this would actually be considering the fact that Starlee owns the other half. They cannot make the show without her so it's basically worthless to them. Would these investors not even try to negotiate with Spotify, see what the price is and make a decision based on that.  But sure this may spook an investor but I find the whole story dubious. Why now? She's had years to buy them out and plenty of fans have offered to crowd fund the pruchase and further production, why does she suddenly have an offer as soon as gimlet is getting acquired. And why if she had this offer was she bad mouthing gimlet as soon as the rumour came out knowing her and the investor would still have to negotiate with gimlet for the show? And we're suppose to believe she had an offer on the table when she kept tweeting about how she probably couldn't trust another podcast company and didn't like the whole industry. Makes no sense  ",1550016970,gimlet
CozyAmigo,"That's the cult with the girl from smallville right? That sounds great, thanks",1550016258,gimlet

antmadison,"Uh... she's been pretty actively employed, as a journalist, since Mystery Show ended. Just because she hasn't hosted her own podcast doesn't mean she's been unemployed since then. ",1550009171,gimlet
antmadison,"Because Gimlet and Starlee each own 50% of Mystery Show and for her to use the property, her and these mystery investors must buy out Gimlet's share of the show. 

Now that Gimlet has been acquired by a major player it isn't unreasonable to expect that the price that Gimlet (or Spotify) will let their share of Mystery Show go for has gone up. Spotify's whole thing is acquiring shows, so letting an IP go so that the show can be made somewhere else just got a lot less likely. ",1550009112,gimlet
FreeThinkk,"Couple interesting articles i found about the people involved in Conviction.

CozyAmigo,"I think the reason you came up with is what she's implying. And if we assume she's telling the truth then it's just dumb to vent on twitter about your old employers and the industry as a whole while trying to negotiate a new deal. If she tweeted this without the previous tweets it would be more beliveable, she finally secures a deal but suddenly that company has to deal with spotify instead of (relatively) tiny gimlet, it would definitely be possible. But she rants about the spotify deal and all of a sudden she has an offer that occurs at the exact same time as the spotify and gimlet deal and that makes her offer go away. It just seems way to convenient an excuse to spew more hate on gimlet.",1549999053,gimlet

McLargepants,"No, after six episodes they liked the show and gave her a year and a years worth of money to make more and she failed to do so, so she was fired and the show was canceled and during the breakup they gave her 50% ownership of the show. I'm not really sure what Gimlet supposedly did wrong in this situation, but my guess is it was handled somewhat unprofessionally based on Starlee's reaction about the whole thing since. A lot of that is filling the small gaps of what has been made public. This all went down years ago now so I don't have the sources on hand but it's worth looking in to. There are plenty of posts on this subreddit about all of it in real time.",1549996551,gimlet

Then when the acquisition rumours came out starlee started talking sh\*t about gimlet even though she knew she would have to negotiate with them to close this deal. Then when the acquisition was made official this third party pulled out because they were scared of negotiating with a big company hence giving starlee another chance to bad mouth gimlet and while this was all happening Starlee was on twitter saying how the podcast industry is poison and that she doesn't trust podcast companies even though she supposedly has an offer from one.

The thing I don't get though is, if she owns half the show (as is widely believed), they can't do anything without her. So it's basically worthless aside from whatever residual ad revenue they get from Season 1. And even if they do care about the ad revenue from Season 1, they can work out a deal to keep that.

Every caller is always perfectly relaxed and charming on tape, as if they either work in the biz or are friends with the hosts.

It is already somehow ""in the air"" as an interesting, quirky topic that one may have encountered online already and thought, ""huh, we should make an episode about that."" 

And, this may be a stretch, but it seems that the show tries to get around the silliness of having a show where the hosts answer questions that are very easily Googleable by stressing that the callers are busy moms who have no time for such internet detective work.

That being said she needs to take some personal responsibility here. She wasn't meeting deadlines. We never knew when episodes were coming out. Time is money. I really hoped mystery show would find a new home (still do) but I don't think Starlee's tweets are helping. Her unwillingness to go to any podcasting company only leaves her with Crowdfunding.

yodatsracist,"I believe when Gimlet was sold to Spotify, people said (be it fact or speculation) that she owned part of Mystery Show and Gimlet owned another part. In order to continue making Mystery Show for another network and in order to use any of the material taped for season 2 that was funded by Gimlet, she’d need to buy out the part of Mystery Show owned by Gimlet (also perhaps the back catalogue of season 1). Gimlet being owned by Spotify conceivably makes buying that intellectual property less likely. 

She could conceivably start a new, similar show with a different name and use none of the tape or research she had prepared for Mystery Show season 2, but she seems disinclined to do that—perhaps the potential season 2 was already such a labor and she already struggled with writer’s block to such an extent she’s worried about starting over from scratch. Starting over with a new name and branding is sort of common in this space. For example, the people behind TL;DR brought out Reply All, the people behind Note to Self brought out Zig Zag, and Jonathan Goldstein’s Wiretap wasn’t so so different from Jonathan Goldstein’s Heavyweight (here the format differences are most obvious because both shows have a bit more shtick rather than just a broad subject).

WinterOfFire,"1 in 10 startups succeed.  When they pay out, you hope it’s enough to cover losses plus some profit enough to be worth the risk.

If you’re a bad investor or just unlucky, you can see it all disappear without picking any winners.  I see it all the time.

The reason they have barriers to non-public company investing is because it’s easy to swindle people who don’t have a lot of experience evaluating investments.  Hell, even those who are experienced get swindled (Fyre, Theranos, juicers etc).  If that barrier wasn’t there, you’re see a LOT more scams and it would be the poor who fell for it (look at MLM and other things the poor fall for).

I see a lot of people’s finances and wish I could have gotten in on some things but I see a lot of investments tank too.

Even if an idea is solid, you need the right people and the right timing to get it done.  Imagine if serial season 2 was as successful as season 1 or if they had put out 10 more podcasts as compelling.  You just can’t always predict what will happen.

That said, I totally would have thrown a couple thousand in on this (willing to lose it all) so it sucks I couldn’t but I understand why I couldn’t.

- An additional 5% for employee option pools at each subsequent round

That $100K - 0.87% of the company at Seed - would be diluted down to 0.47% of the company at the time of sale, which would be worth $1,083,000 - a return of about 11X.

spotify can't rely on streams either, and it has to know this by now. spotify is still not turning a net profit, not enough people subscribe instead of staying ad-supported and ads currently don't bring enough revenue. keeping the majority of gimlet content on spotify is simply squandering its value, and owning anchor means both a shot in the arm for internal analytics and a freaking product they can sell to other producers instead of waiting for the average consumer to pay for a subscription.",1549528770,gimlet

The brain trust at gimlet has ""the eye"" for good content. They produce high quality shows, they've been very good at running lean by cutting shows that don't fit their goals, they tell very high quality stories, and they've proven they know how to scale, and play in the big leagues. I don't think they'd make it to a billion dollars by producing ad driven podcasts, but how many podcasts companies have Julia Roberts in their critically acclaimed TV series? My point is, as far as I can tell, these guys have talent, drive, and connections - and it shows in their end product, and their business decisions. I scale startup companies for a living, and I've only ever had two customers that grew like these guys have. Both were in previously unestablished markets, and now they own those multi billion dollar markets, and are valued in the billions.

As an aside, I think it's right to be worried about these kinds of takeovers, not just because of how it'll change gimlet, but how it's going to change podcasting.

Agreed.  I've always wondered how long this wonderful podcast system would last.  But overhead is low (compared to something like a radio station) for most podcast producers.  Some are very successful under the current system.  But I think part of that is because advertisers are throwing money at these podcasts without really having an understanding of how much reach they are getting.  If Spotrac (or somebody else) can start providing better broadcast statistics, those podcasters that are successful now may not be able to continue to draw that kind of revenue.

Sure, there are great podcasts produced on a shoestring budget, especially those of the ""some people talking about some topic in front of a mic"" variety, but I'm not sure if the current ad-supported model can is really enough to refinance the type of shows Gimlet is doing; especially since advertising is seen as a dirty word by many people and most podcast clients make it trivial to skip ads with a few taps/clicks and – unlike many other quality podcasts – Gimlet's shows are completely independent from public radio funding.",1549478447,gimlet

ClockOfTheLongNow,"Recode reported 18 months ago that Gimlet's valuation was at around $70 million. Since then, we've seen more growth in the podcast market period, and it's worth noting that the Amazon deal for *Homecoming*, the TV rights for *Sandra*, and that Reply All episode movie deal all happened since then (not to mention *Green Book* and *Dirty John* also becoming successful podcast properties turned into visual media). Tripling that valuation in roughly 18 months with the type of success Gimlet has had in a hot industry doesn't seem weird at all.

Spotify wants to be the Netflix of audio. I think that much is clear. The issue is that you can easily wall up visual content in ways that are really difficult in an established area like podcasts. Spotify would be asking the hundreds of millions who listen to podcasts to abandon how they do it in favor of their own content, and I don't think that's really doable.

Now, if they make the app more free and they get it preloaded on most phones and such, Mayne that changes. But we're talking years and years down the line there, and a massive sea change overall in the expectations surrounding how we consume audio-only media.

I'm skeptical this is the long term plan (though would happy to be wrong).  I can't believe Gimlet is inherently worth $230M.

What makes you think that?

My assumption is that Spotify is making this investment to become a player in the podcast space.  They want their app to be used.  I assume they want to stream the podcast, so ads can't be skipped and they can track listens (not just downloads) to more effectively sell ad space.

As a listener, the podcast model has been great for the last ~10 years.  I have gotten a way better ratio of content-to-ads than I used to get when I listened to AM radio.  But if this succeeds, it could be a bad road for podcast consumers.

mi-16evil,"Not for them because Spotify wants to become the Netflix of podcasts. They've said it before. What Netflix has is a constant stream of original programming that is meant to keep you subscribed because you never want to be stuck without it when their next great show/movie is released. Spotify is trying to do the same thing. They want to have exclusive rights to major hit podcasts that means they have so many options you just have to pay for the service. No ads is one of the selling points of trading off free content for paid. 

The gamble for Spotify is that unlike film/television podcasts are usually free. Some people pay for Stitcher Premium or individual Patreons but even those people get most of their podcasts for free. The ads are accepted because we know it's why we get them free. It's also shown that it's very very tough to take something that was free and demand payment for it. See how hard it was for newspapers when their print subscribers dried up and they wanted to be paid for online.

I am a huge fan of Reply All and Heavyweight. They are easily in my 10 favorite podcasts. I always put them at the top of my listening queue every time they are released. Even I, as painful as it is to say, would probably let them go if they went behind a paywall. I just already have so many podcasts and while I'd be very sad I just wouldn't see the value if there wasn't more behind that paywall.

Right now, giant podcast brands still lean on opt-in listener surveys to see who is listening. However, I think some of Alex's other ideas are much more interesting. He talked about being able to feed images during the course of a show to the player, for example. Or having better methods for sharing external links in a way that doesn't break immersion. That seems so simple, but right now the only way is to say ""Look at our blog post for pictures and citations.""

lovegiblet,"As soon as you make the model ""venture capital funded"", you're the bad guy.  As soon as you base your funding model on venture capital investment, you are putting the needs of your investors above your listeners.  It's not like all companies that operate like this are evil, but it is what it is.  There are models for creating podcasts that treat creators and the listener community as top priorities (Maximum Fun comes to mind), but they do that at the expense of fast growth.  There are definitely ways to have a start up model and still be ethical and care about listeners, but if you are consuming something that exists to make money for investors on a large scale (which Alex was very upfront about, he said he wanted this to be the Google of podcasts or something like that), know that you as a listener are a piece of the machinery designed to do that.  Listener satisfaction can still be important, but really only as a means to make money.  That's the goal in that model, every time.

ClockOfTheLongNow,"&gt; If all shows continue to be available in a public RSS feed accessible by any podcatcher app, great! But the likelihood of that is extremely low.

Early statements from Spotify seem to indicate that they understand the decentralized nature of podcasts and do not see any reason to change that in the near term.

&gt; When accessing podcasts through a public RSS on a privacy-focused app like Overcast on iOS, the amount of info the company gains on you is minimal and not personally identifiable

Yeah, but that ship sailed ages ago with the use of the Apple iTunes/podcast environment. Then there's the rise of Stitcher, Google's play in the environment, and so on.

The reality is that expecting your info to be kept private in a modern world is a fool's errand, and this move is not meaningfully going to change the game in any appreciable way.

&gt; Now, since you need to offer up your email address at minimum to sign up for Spotify (much more for Premium), they’ll have a lot more info on you.

They'll have the info thanks to the information you provided the forty other apps on your phone.

&gt; Another concern is user experience. The Spotify app just doesn’t have a lot of the features focused Podcast apps do.

Yet. This acquisition, along with the Anchor purchase, is a massive investment in the field, and their app needs upgrades to make it work. I'm sure they're aware of it.

What concerns me is not so much that Spotify isn't up to the challenge, but instead how poorly their app/experience for music has been for longtime users in particular. Simple things like notifications about new releases don't even work properly.

But I have no intention of using Spotify as my primary podcast vehicle, and I see little indication at this stage that Spotify will force me to do so for Gimlet content.

In my view, the best case scenario is that the Gimlet catalog and news shows move to the Spotify app exclusively but are still accessible without paying for a Spotify Premium account. Worst case is Spotify app exclusivity that is also locked behind the Premium paywall. 

Both scenarios come with negatives. To me, privacy is the biggest.

Lisse24,"As others have said, it's moving podcasts towards a distribution model that mirrors what we've seen happen in T.V. If this move gets the traction that Spotify intends, instead of having different content creators produce podcasts that are able to be viewed on a platform of choice, you'll begin to see podcasts tied to certain platforms. This means that as podcasts become big, people will go to 'Platform A' for all of their podcasts, because that's where the podcasts they like are. Maybe they'll get an app for Platform B, too, maybe not. In short, instead of having one app with all your podcasts, you'll have to choose which podcasts you really care about and choose that podcast creator's parent company's app to listen to. 

This set up will make it nearly impossible for small, independent podcasters to gain traction. In order for a podcast to get enough listens to become viable, it will have to partner with a platform, just like ABC partners with Hulu, etc.  All those weird, quirky, lovable podcasts you like? Won't happen. This set up doesn't allow for 99% Invisible or Hardcore History or Criminal or Sleep with Me or even that couple who talks about your favorite TV show.

Craishton,"For music, no. They're fine for that (I'm a Premium subscriber for close to a decade now!).

For podcasts? Yes. As it has been no corporation has had control over podcasts. As long as you can upload an episode to the internet, anyone could listen to it in their podcast app. That's one bad thing. Another one is that the way podcasts have worked no one can track anything you do. They get an IP adress when you download the episode and that's that. They can't tell what other podcasts you listen to, they can't tell how you listen to their podcasts. With platforms such as Spotify you're going to get the same tracking you get everywhere else. They're going to be tracking where you are when you listen to certain podcasts (literally where you are - at work, at home, taking a walk). They're going to be looking at how you listen to podcasts (when do you pause, what length of podcast is optimal to get you to listen the way they want you to, do you skip ads, etc). They're going to know all of the podcasts you listen to. They're going to have the ability to stop you from, for example, skipping ads. There're going to be tons of platform exclusives.

She seems to feel that she was a major contributer to gimlet's current success and will unfairly not benefit from any exit but also feels upset that her continued contribution wasn't required to achieve that exit and that means gimlet is getting rewarded for making what she feels is a bad decision (cancelling the show).,1549443395,gimlet

bking,"&gt;	Spotify money means more travel, hiring researchers to cast a wider net, or just having ‘problem’ money they can dish out.

I’ve done a lot of work in documentary television, including work on little shows that were sold to larger entities.

If you prove that you can provide “successful program about X on budget $Y”, your show will be expected to continue to produce program X on budget $Y, regardless of who owns it.

The fact that somebody higher up the chain is making a profit off your show does not usually manifest itself in your budget getting bigger. From the perspective of accountants, producers and shareholders, there needs to be a **very** compelling reason to re-invest that money and risk the program becoming less profitable.",1549434819,gimlet
bking,"Think beyond high-budget shows and networks like Gimlet. Podcasts (including the first season of StartUp) are very cheap to produce and release. Those small-budget podcasts still get to have a chance of succeeding because they don’t need to be sold into a premium network like Spotify or Stitcher. If those producers can make an MP3 file and shit out an RSS feed, they’re on exactly the same playing field as Heavyweight or Pod Save America. 

I ran a mildly successful show from 2006 to about 2012, starting with one mic plugged into my laptop and eventually expanding into a decent multitrack recording setup. All of the gear, hosting and miscellaneous expenses were covered by listener donations. These shows can glide along on very little money, and that accessibility makes them great.

The only thing that would truly make podcasting financially unsustainable would be the addition of some kind of gatekeeping that makes it harder for new shows to find success on the charts, or be included in people’s podcatchers. 

It’s also worth noting that listeners having the ability to skip sponsor reads doesn’t seem to be holding many shows back, or killing on-air ad reads. People have been able to skip podcast ads since the very beginning, and the medium has had no problem growing around that fact. The reality of that is baked into ad sales, and medium-sized shows still get ads booked out for months. It’s fine. 

The whole Podcasting ecosystem *could* be optimized for serving better ads, but there’s really no need, and no good pitch for listeners (or Apple) to adopt it over the current model.",1549434075,gimlet

Haven't used it in years. All my other podcasts are in Podcast Addict and when I listen to podcasts I open that app, hit play and go on my way. It never even occurs to me to switch to a different one while I'm listening, and I can't switch anyway if I'm driving for example.

thethirdrayvecchio,"Having worked production in the past, pursuing stories requires time and energy - especially when they involve travel or longitudinal coverage. This cuts into viability of the story and many may have to be killed because they end up going nowhere. Even sourcing a story requires a huge amount of initial outlay, something I think that came through this series of Heavyweight with three of the nine stories stemming from Alex, Jonathan, and Soraya - who seems to be a new hire at Gimlet.

If you're dealing with difficulties finding or covering stories, throwing money at the issue usually resolves the problem. 

From my perspective this means:

**a)** Spotify money means more travel, hiring researchers to cast a wider net, or just having 'problem' money they can dish out.

**b)** Spotify money comes with additional scrutiny and caveats. Will they be allowed to cover any stories they like? What if a story reflects badly on Spotify or other parent companies?

A show that is loss making but bringing in a ton of  listener growth probably has more chance at a network like gimlet. If the show was unsustainable at a company with VC cash and strong ad revenue I can't see starlee being able pay her production costs simply on a share of the donations to a company like maximum fun.

Dain42,"MaxFun is largely donor supported, not ad-supported. A large majority of the money at MaxFun comes from members who make monthly donations. That money is distributed to the various podcasts based on a user survey completed at the time of donation (and which they prompt you to update every year with what you're currently listening to).

Maximum Fun is directly paying all the folks who are in the network, and the staff at their office in LA definitely seem to provide additional logistical support for a lot of the podcasts, including paying producers or editors for a number of shows, as well as providing recording space for some of the ones made in LA.

The fundamental difference isn't in how they fund and make stuff, though. It in the nature of the companies. Jesse Thorn is just a nice guy who is just trying to support himself and his family, while also helping other podcasters do the same. He's not out to make a fortune or turn around and sell MaxFun for a huge profit.

Gimlet, on the other hand is a startup. It's not just trying to make enough money to pay everyone a decent wage and keep the lights on. They're taking VC money, and there's the expectation of turning around and selling out to a bigger fish at some point (apparently some point very soon), in order to pay off those VC's investments.

Frankly, I think the latter was kind of a crazy idea for a podcast network.

Show that takes forever to produce and doesn't produce a lot of ad revenue = a bad show to invest in, especially for a business in its early stages. The stories are creative and take a long time to produce, but you have to have some stop-gap content in there as well to make up for the wait or figure out a different funding model. 

I really liked MS. I really did. But Starlee is acting like an entitled art student who thinks she should be fed endless amounts of money to produce something with (what sounded like) very little tangible benefit to the business.

That was a really weak part of the show, trying to argue that because a rule got overturned somehow that made robocalls increase much more than before the rule?  It’s just speculation not an answer to what they were investigating.  Also they grossly oversimplified what the issue was and tried to imply that somehow the court was nitpicking because they wanted to overturn the decision (which makes no sense because it was a liberal DC court deciding an issue that was reviewing rules passed by the FCC during the Obama administration).

A better summary would be that Congress passed a law which FCC had to turn into a set of specific rules for the telecom industry.  Over the years the FCC became very complicated, some contradictory with each other and not consistent with the original law.  The wording about “capable” mentioned in the show was actually added as a deliberate attempt to stop the manual dialing mentioned in the show.  This was the opposite of the impression given during the show.

Finally, the law is not overturned; what we need is the FCC to make some clearer rules.  Are they doing this? Is it delayed because the membership of the FCC is different under Trump?  The show didn’t bother to look into it.",1549291625,gimlet

WikiTextBot,"**Real-time strategy**

Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games where the game does not progress incrementally in turns.In an RTS, the participants position and maneuver units and structures under their control to secure areas of the map and/or destroy their opponents' assets. In a typical RTS, it is possible to create additional units and structures during the course of a game. This is generally limited by a requirement to expend accumulated resources. These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special points on the map and/or possessing certain types of units and structures devoted to this purpose.

I'm a big fan of Maximum Fun, which uses the model you describe. But comparing Maximum Fun and its artist-owned content, and Gimlet with its corporate-owned content is like comparing apples to oranges. Let's take My Brother, My Brother, and Me--one of MaxFun's biggest podcasts. MaxFun does not employ Justin, Griffin, and Travis. I doubt they are even considered contractors. The brothers purchase their own equipment, record their own shows, edit the episodes, and post them on schedule. The only thing MaxFun does is help them monetize their shows by selling advertising on their behalf, and help them advertise on other in-network shows. The brothers are basically self-employed, and have partnered with MaxFun as a way to monetize something they already do all on their own.

Gimlet, on the other hand, hires its hosts, producers, etc. Alex and PJ, Brittany and Eric, and all of the other hosts (and presumably Starlee at the time) get a salary. They have health care. They are employees of Gimlet. Gimlet owns the equipment they use to record shows. Editors hired and paid by Gimlet edit the shows in Gimlet buildings.

anneoftheisland,"&gt;""And therein lies the rub doesn’t it? They’ve always maintained that I would have to pay them to restart it and have always refused any sort of deal that involves me getting the episodes back""

My understanding is that she owns half the show and Gimlet owns half the show. So in order for her to continue making Mystery Show, she’d either need to buy out their half or find somebody who’s willing to do so. Gimlet is by far the biggest podcasting company in the game, so their shows are worth more than anybody else (or Starlee) can pay. And I doubt they have any interest in buying out Starlee’s half of the show, because it sounded like it was too expensive to continue making. 

That is frustrating, but it’s also par for the course—at least in TV, where show creators/developers rarely own *any* of their creations. (It’s hard to compare Gimlet to other podcasting networks, as they aren’t broadcasting companies and have a completely different business model.)

But as with TV show creators, there’s nothing stopping her from creating a new show and going to another network (or just releasing it on her own).

anneoftheisland,"&gt;""And therein lies the rub doesn’t it? They’ve always maintained that I would have to pay them to restart it and have always refused any sort of deal that involves me getting the episodes back""

My understanding is that she owns half the show and Gimlet owns half the show. So in order for her to continue making Mystery Show, she’d either need to buy out their half or find somebody who’s willing to do so. Gimlet is by far the biggest podcasting company in the game, so their shows are worth more than anybody else (or Starlee) can pay. And I doubt they have any interest in buying out Starlee’s half of the show, because it sounded like it was too expensive to continue making. 

That is frustrating, but it’s also par for the course—at least in TV, where show creators/developers rarely own *any* of their creations. (It’s hard to compare Gimlet to other podcasting networks, as they aren’t broadcasting companies and have a completely different business model.)

But as with TV show creators, there’s nothing stopping her from creating a new show and going to another network (or just releasing it on her own). She may feel taken advantage of by Gimlet, but they gave her an opportunity to develop name recognition and an audience that she can take with her.

Mystery Show debuted at a time when Serial Season 1 was finished airing but popular culture was still positively abuzz with discussion of podcasts because of it and a lot of new people were discovering the medium. Mystery Show came at just the right time to capitalize on that.

Show gets cancelled, obviously not great (though maybe understandable if you are taking much longer than agreed/anticipated to complete any new episodes. Show gets cancelled and you no longer have the right not just to the episodes you already made under the Gimlet umbrella but also the whole concept/name of your show - that bit worse.

The music labels charge enough such that the orange line is just below the dark blue line, resulting in a gross profit (solid grey line), a few hundred-million over zero.  After accounting for other expenses (light blue line), Spotify is still not profitable (green line).

Spotify's best chance at gaining bargaining power is to pull a Netflix and create or buy its own content.  But generating new music isn't as easy as new TV shows.  Listeners like to mix in older songs.  But there are passionate listeners who mostly listen to new content.

No they're not. People can't be owned. And unless they're under contract, they can leave the day after the acquisition. 

&gt; The company is more than just the on-air personalities

The company isn't the on-air personalities at all, who are likely contractors, not employees. It's not clear who owns the actual shows. Some podcast networks, like MaxFun, the hosts own the shows. Whereas Earwolf owns the shows they develop. I don't know who owns Gimlet's shows. 

&gt; They're buying the ad-selling arm, which Spotify could use, and the branded-podcast arm which doesn't rely on one individual host. 

Maybe. The listener response to the branded podcasts has been pretty poor, but who knows, maybe they perform well financially. But even if it is, it's not ownable/proprietary. Anyone can make branded/native content. It's not a reason to buy a company. 

&gt; They're removing competition from their own podcasts (if there are any, or if they would build a podcast arm in the future if the sale didn't happen).

Honestly, if they go into a subscription model, I'll thankfully drop out of said podcast.  I have too much to listen to anyways, not even mentioning all the awesome audiobooks I don't even bother to listen to because podcasts have endless content for me to listen to.

Deerfield1797,"""They"" works in a couple of different ways as a gender neutral pronoun. It's often used when you're talking about a singular person but don't know their gender. For example: ""Did you see that driver? They are really bad at driving!"" Technically you could also say, ""He or she is really bad at driving!"" But native speakers tend to just use ""they"". 

&amp;#x200B;

It also works in a second way, which is the way that it's being used in this post. Recently, more people have become comfortable not identifying as a man or a woman. Instead, they will identify as ""gender neutral"" or ""gender queer"", which just means that they don't feel like they are a man or a woman in particular. Calling these people ""he"" or ""she"" wouldn't make sense if you are respecting their gender neutral identity. Using ""they"" as a singular pronoun works well in this situation because it doesn't carry any gendered connotations. For example: ""Christina just went home because they forgot their laptop.""

The only really interesting part of this episode was the reveal that lawmakers were influenced by marketing interests to repeal a law that was helping consumers avoid spam.

I understand that including your phone number in that packet is next level invasive, but if they're outraged that phone and IP info is being sold to marketers for illegitimate purposes, why was there zero discussion of what a ""legitimate"" purpose would be for harvesting and selling somebodies data to a 3rd party?

Then I heard her on The Pitch and she came off way better. She was calmer, she was ready with (most) of the numbers and she made a really solid case for the business and the expense of it.

I was surprised as hell when she got all investors in on it. This showed a really contrast between the styles of the two shows and the personalities of the investors.

My only complaint is with the producer follow up interviews this season.

*****
&gt; Foxconn Technology Group is reconsidering plans to make advanced liquid crystal display panels at a $10 billion Wisconsin campus, and said it intends to hire mostly engineers and researchers rather than the manufacturing workforce the project originally promised.

&gt; Rather than a focus on LCD manufacturing, Foxconn wants to create a &amp;quot;Technology hub&amp;quot; in Wisconsin that would largely consist of research facilities along with packaging and assembly operations, Woo said.

&gt; Foxconn is formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Rather than manufacturing LCD panels in the United States, Woo said it would be more profitable to make them in greater China and Japan, ship them to Mexico for final assembly, and import the finished product to the United States.

I understand reporting, and this is an excellent, well-done job of it, but does it really stop at reporting?  If it's only this Reply All world, Mount Pleasant, and Foxconn who know the the way a whole community is getting f\*cked, is there really nothing more to be done about someone like Degroot needing to be castrated and sent off to an island? 

The odds are that nobody actually DID anything by reporting on \*or\* listening to this episode. We just got heated up. Maybe the right person listened and something could happen (??), but ... doubtful. I'm not trying to complain here, I'm just trying to understand this feeling of helplessness ...

So, this might be a more philosophical question, but is there some personal responsibility we're ignoring by being part of exposing something TRULY heinous and then doing absolutely nothing save talk about it? And by ""being part of,"" I mean the reporters \*and\* us listeners. 

Do we shake our heads, walk away, and know that eventually we'll forget and move on? Sure, this goes back to a failure in their own town's democracy (how did such a horrible selection of people become the decision-makers?), and sure, we're not directly affected, but this should seriously be stopped.

&gt; Season two will further explore the storyline that was teased in the season one finale post-credits scene that featured Colin Belfast (Cannavale) and his newly minted Geist Group superior Audrey Temple (Hong Chau) squaring off, with Audrey calming her nerves with a mysterious medicine after the encounter. It suggests creators' Micah Bloomberg and Eli Horowitz's continued interest in exploring the world of *Homecoming*, albeit without Heidi and Walter as the central characters.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; That *Homecoming* would chart its second season without Roberts comes as the series is taking a hard detour from its Gimlet Media podcast on which the series is based. In the podcast version of the story, Heidi spends the entire second season searching in vain for Walter (James on the Amazon take). Seeing as the Amazon adaptation already concluded Heidi's search for Walter, [albeit in ambiguous fashion](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/homecoming-finale-explained-1157860), it seems her story now is truly at its end.

What we know if that her original deal was for 1 season, that season 1 basically combined both of the podcast's two seasons, and that Heidi won't be a regular part of season 2 of the TV series. It doesn't say anywhere what order those decisions were made in or why.

To speculate though, I'd say the creative team was aware that season 2 of the podcast lost momentum and suffered because they moved away from the central relationship between Heidi and Cruz, so they streamlined that plot into the climax of season 1. Imo that worked well, but it also kind of bookends Heidi's arc, so I'd guess the intention from the beginning was that Roberts wouldn't return but they didn't want to announce that until the show had a chance to gain traction.",1547681962,gimlet

I also think people who don't really watch tv but listen to podcasts might get pulled into watching a podcast turned tv.

im_not_your_uncle,"&gt;Was that just due to their wifi signal being strongest? 

Nope. 

For now, think about home wifi as an extension on the data towers. Since wifi data goes through these towers anyway. 

The way it works is that an app will try to communicate to your phone through many different data towers as much as it can. Since exact location of data towers are public, they can use it to triangulate any device that communicates with it.

In order to find your phone, you need at least 3 towers  to pin point its exact location. This is how triangulation works. But when there are not enough towers, we are forced to guess the point.

Triangulation using wifi is just another layer. Basically, they triangulate the positions of wifi routers using the towers. And use the known position of the routers to pin point your phone. So triangulation using wifi routers doesn't work well if there are not enough towers in the first place.",1547560420,gimlet

squarahann,"I understand that sentiment but I think there is merit to Blumberg’s work. Before Gimlet and radiotopia, there was just NPR. The most you could aspire to was working on This American Life and WNYC. Public radio has a lot of limitations of the types of shows you can do and the way you get picked up by networks. Many of the people at Gimlet worked at these broadcasting corporations and left to join gimlet because there were not options for their careers. In short, he did a pretty cool thing. Yeah, they compliment him a lot but I think it’s also in jest too because Alex can be a little awkward. But he’s worked on some amazing shows in his career and has a really awesome track record prior to gimlet. He also created an opportunity for other podcasters to make more creative and desirable content than your classic NPR model. 

The interview with Ira Glass on the Podcast without fail talks about it. Also the first season of start up is about him starting Gimlet. Both provide a good picture of the ecosystem of audio journalism prior to Gimlet.

Yep - if I was the one waiting, I'd value the fact that Alex put time and energy into this to make something - no matter how 'poor' it may have been.

thethirdrayvecchio,"&gt;Yeah, exactly. Alex really comes off as a bad person in this one.  
&gt;  
&gt;My first thought when I heard the premise was that clearly Alex is a big bundle of anxiety about this. You know how, when you procrastinate on something important, it feels like it snowballs? The anxiety builds, and soon it's just this crippling feeling that stops you from making progress?

I think we've all heard enough about him to know he's not a 'bad person' but this isn't karmically great. It's like instead of [working your ass off to finish something you promised to someone else](https://www.gimletmedia.com/heavyweight/20-soraya#episode-player), you just got someone else to do it and coasted to dinner. 

And poster above is right. Whether he may have said it in the room, there's little reference to the fact that he just delegated because - no matter how you cut it - making this right wasn't as important to him as running his business. ",1547478101,gimlet
thethirdrayvecchio,"&gt;I was hoping to find this comment. I thought the episode was very funny but it didn't hit me in the feels like it normally does. That girl who got all her research done, that was just lovely.

This is specifically why I came here. There was a massive element of Alex's 'Heavyweight' being lifted but he did nothing except bring the cassettes in. I would have thought that Jonathan would have used his influence on the show to push Alex into being more involved in the edit, especially when he did the same earlier on in the season with Soraya. Could have been fun given the running joke that Jonathan has with Alex as a boss throughout the series. But nope.

I think Jonathan embroidered the story brilliantly as always but it's not a great look. 

Also: And shit! I didn't realise that they were helped by the Soraya from the previous episode. Most likely solution is that they got the story from working with her rather than other way around. Very odd they didn't highlight who she was in the episode but it looks like they're increasingly drawing-down internally with three episodes coming courtesy of Gimlet staff: Alex, Jonathan (and his criticism of Russian Ark), and her.

Your laptop, my cellphone, that wireless router. The company said they were all at the same arbitrary point on a map. An arbitrary point that just happened to be down the street from Christina and Mike’s house.  

Basically he's talking about how cell phones can get some geolocation through wifi. If you see a router for the local Starbucks, you know you're close to the local Starbucks.

The problem is that geolocation works by associating routers with an address, and the company who gathered all those address messed up just put you next to Christina and Mike's address for everything.

simplequark,"The company maintaining the database doesn't have enough data points for that particular area to really figure out the detailed location of a device in it. The best they can do is ""it must be somewhere in this general area"". Imagine, for example, they were able to determine that it must be the in (fictional) town of Smallville, but not exactly where. 

In that case, their systems will return a kind of default point for that area, e.g., in our example that could be a point at the geographical center of Smallville. This would be returned for any nearby device for which they cannot get an exact position. So, if your house happens to be at the geographical center of Smallville, it'll be listed as the location for lots of devices that were detected somewhere in the general vicinity. 

How large that vicinity may be depends entirely on the way that company set up their systems. However, it seems like it could be rather large areas, so the actual location of the device may be miles away from the indicated point.",1547400865,gimlet

",1547379772,gimlet
simplequark,"The explanation for that one was really a bit muddled in the episode.

Basically, it works like this: There are companies that maintain databases of the geographical locations of WiFi networks and cell phone towers. That allows their customers to map any device connected to those networks (like when you’re using “show my position” in Google Maps). 

Unfortunately, their data isn’t always precise. Especially in areas with not many WiFi networks and/or few cell phone towers, there might not be enough data to triangulate an exact location. In those cases, they’ll just give a point in the general neighborhood of the actual position, maybe near the geographical center of that part of town. Again, like Google Maps when you have this big circle of uncertainty around your position dot.

However, these companies don’t necessarily indicate that their approximate result is not exact. Or maybe they do but their customers don’t parse that information. In any case, users who use this data to search, e.g., for a stolen phone, see a dot that seems to tell them where exactly their device is, not realizing that it’s only an approximate location. So they go there, trying to get it back, which isn’t nice for the people living there. Especially if this happens to be a part of town in which many stolen phones end up, because many or all of these devices, ni matter where exactly they are, would give their position as being on that particular address.

nemoomen,"""The Cathedral"" opens with this:

&gt;PJ VOGT: Hey, it’s PJ, quick note before we start the show: a lot of people are hearing Reply All for the first time this week. And we wanted to direct you to some episodes that you might like in addition to this one. So, **Episode 29, “The Takeover,”** that is one of our favorites, it is about the most teenage teenager I have ever met in my life. And the fake company he started on the internet. **Episode 42, “Blind Spot,”** has Sruthi essentially by sheer force of will turning herself into a real life House and investigating a medical mystery. And then **Episode 47, “Quit Already!”** That is about a grandmother who made a Facebook post that accidentally helped topple a government. So, check out those episodes, check out the rest of the archives, and enjoy this week’s episode.

I think that's sort of interesting, good advice, I'd say (especially to enjoy this week's episode...The Cathedral itself) for people who might have started listening in 2016 or later, there are early gems that we have forgotten by now. 

But of course this recommendation list only goes to January 2016 and their best episodes come later, so take recommendations from the rest of the folks in this thread.",1546912542,gimlet

Like for example in the OG Handles story, Alex basically hangs out in Maxime's Discord for weeks if not months, listening in on the voice chat and just *hoping* it leads somewhere. And this is for Super Tech Support stories, which are relatively light and straightforward usually! Just imagine how much tape had to be listened to for The Crime Machine or how much time had to be dedicated to Long Distance or how much research and how many interviews had to be done for the story about Backpage... It's mind-boggling to me.

They put out 20 episodes last year, and let's say they themselves investigated 2/3 of those (with other producers taking the rest), that still leaves like 6 or so for each of them. They're each investigating 6 stories for a few months at a time? And those are just the ones that we hear?? Like... do these people sleep???",1546877036,gimlet

Given all those factors, I'm pretty satisfied with the release schedule of Heavyweight.

They released 20 last year, so that's not the case at all.

&gt; I understand that it’s really high quality a lot of the time and takes to to produce, however

I mean, what more is there to say than that? The rate limiting factor is their team. They could allocate a lot more people to Reply All, but then people would be upset that it's not PJ and Alex hosting, or that they're reporting on stories they weren't intimately involved in researching. Either way people would say it's lost its charm. 

So if it's gonna be primarily a small team researching, producing and hosting it, it's gonna take a long time. Deep-dive stories as engaging as those typically on Reply All take a long time to make, and a lot of their stories need to be killed because they just don't meet the standards they set for themselves (and if they lower those standards, people will complain and the team themself won't be satisfied). 

Even after acknowledging how long it must take to make a show like Reply All, I guarantee it takes at least twice as long as you or I would expect.

acjohnson55,"Good question.

Success Academy is part of a movement that generally believes that subjecting public education to market forces will produce better results than treating it as a government service, in the traditional approach. This is often called the ed reform movement. This philosophy manifests in a number of different ways (in different combinations):

* Schools should be judged by standardized exam results so that parents can vote with their feet.
* Services at schools can be subcontracted out to private entities.
* School funding should be determined by the number of students the school can attract.
* Teacher effectiveness should be evaluated by exam results.
* Teachers should be paid by their effectiveness.
* Instruction itself should be data-driven.
* Best practices can be used to replicate success ad infinitum.

I don't think any of these ideas are bad, per se. But I'm not convinced there's strong reason to believe they will result in better education for the most at-risk students.

Success Academy obviously doesn't fit all of the things mentioned above. But the story shows where some of the downsides creep in:

* Perverse incentives when it comes to struggling students.
* Stack-ranking teachers can undermine healthy cooperation.
* Difficulties replicating systems at scale.
* Exam-driven curriculum.
* De-personalization experienced by students, parents, and teachers.
   * The students reporting depression.
   * Draconian punishment systems.
   * Teachers flipping out.

I don't want to paint Success Academy as evil, by any means. I Just have deeply mixed feelings about them and about my own experience in the ed reform movement.",1546663391,gimlet
slybird,"They can measure results and test anyway they want and however often they want, but the only measure that matters is how many children actually finish a college degree and then get decent paying jobs.

ditherbob,"So here’s the thing. SA operates like it does because its student population is at risk (chaotic home lives) and the traditional public schools are unable to provide the education that this population wants. Clearly if you can have the model schools of what the wealthy white suburban schools filled with rich parents with stable home lives and have it work here you would do it. But that model won’t work.

ditherbob,"I agree that the ultimate metric is how they do in college. Somehow though I think that these kids will do fine. If they can handle crying in the hallways and the harsh academic demands of SA that will prepare them academically for college. I don’t think that if my HS was easier it would have prepared me better for college. I saw a lot of my peers in college weren’t prepared to make it to the ‘next level’ academically.

The discipline aspect of SA doesn’t turn me off. I went through the Catholic school system in he 80’s and the disciple was very similar to what the podcast described. Lots of kids got educated this way and turned out great. 

And you also have to separate ‘worker drone’ from just discipline. We were always encouraged to think for ourselves but there was an emphasis on discipline and self control. Everyone wore a uniform and were expected to sit up straight and address the teacher in a specific way.  Looking back it seems to me (whether intentional or not) that it trained the kids from a very basic level to have self control and make disciplined choices (eg, I will study for an hour and not watch TV).",1546614781,gimlet

Nothing Success Academy does is groundbreaking pedagogy or education process.  Your public school district likely has a high performing, traditional public school with great teachers.

acjohnson55,"&gt;It also make me wonder - do these areas need educational triage?  Some  kids need a safe place, with more emphasis on coping strategies and life  skills, with reduced scholastic expectations where the school is judged  on a different basis, whereas others can cope with the strict  discipline of a place like Success Academy.  This isn’t to say they  don’t have the same potential, but an acknowledgement that “algebra just  isn’t top of mind.”  Maybe they also need more time (years) of school  if they need or want it.

This is something I thought *a lot* about as a teacher and listening to this series brought it back for me. The dichotomy of promotion/retention was discussed many times throughout the series, but it's extremely frustrating that the dichotomy itself is rarely ever seriously critiqued. Why *don't* we have solutions for children who are behind par in some subjects but not others? It's not as though the numbers are too small.

I would love to see a system where we poured resources into the students most likely to fall behind. I hypothesize that:

* With focused attention, those students might be able to actually get back on track.
* The classrooms where the remainder of students are would perform better.

The key here is that remedial education wouldn't be where we give up; it would be where we devote the greatest level of investment.

As an aside, this reminds me of how floored I was that Success Academy would even consider academic retention (being held back) as punishment for violations of student expectations. That's straight up perverse to me.",1546489938,gimlet

acjohnson55,"I've become a big critic of this concept of ""failing"". I taught at the height of the movement to close down failing schools and replace them and their staffs with brand new schools (this was exactly the case for my school). This has been the trend nationwide, and the results are not encouraging.

It turns out, the school is like a vital organ in many impoverished communities. When you pull it out and try to build a new one, you've disrupted countless relationships, immeasurable communal memory, and often times, the social services people were depending on. New schools find that they not only have to produce test results, they have to rebuild these other functions from the ground up. It's not so easy.

These old schools certainly do tend to be failing to produce high test scores and good college outcomes. This is a big problem. But they're often succeeding at doing a lot of things that aren't being measured or recognized.

&gt;Charter schools typically start with the same or even fewer resources -  they're still publicly funded, after all, they just are their own  district instead of following district rules.

That's often not true, especially for the best charters. As explained in the story, Success Academy had additional resources from its hedge fund founders.

As an aside, there's also a very dark side to the charter movement, in which some charter schools effectively serve as mechanisms for channeling public dollars into for-profit service providers that charter operators subcontract with.

But the reputable ones tend to also be better resourced than their purely public peer schools.

&gt;In practice, I agree that there are several examples of ""undesirable""  students being pushed out, but that's already against the rules. I would  argue we should better enforce the rules instead of throwing the baby  out with the bathwater.

It's not against the rules to convince people that your school is not a good fit for a challenging student.

There are several ways in which this filtering happens:

* A prerequisite of getting in is applying, which requires that someone in that child's life is savvy enough to know that there are options. This alone partitions the population of students by economic situation. My wife taught at the zone school in my section of the city, and her student profile was very different than mine.
* The expectations from students and parents can be extremely intimidating to families already struggling to cope with life pressures. These are often the most precarious and challenged students. Many such families opt out in advance.
* Suspensions and conferences force parents to have to stay home from work, financially impacting them. The schools often advise these parents on options that are less strenuous.

&gt;I'd argue that 5% of students getting a better education is way better  than 0% of students getting a better education. And the reason Success  Academy has grown so quickly is to try to meet that incredible demand.

But the question should be whether our aggregate social outcomes are improved by having this tiered system of selective schools, charter schools, and default schools. The most relatively well adjusted children have *always* found better results in inner city school systems. We may be achieving the same aggregate results, but with a great deal more complexity.

**In conclusion**

I want to be clear that I'm not fundamentally anti-charter or anti-choice. It's just that I'm highly skeptical that the results produced by the most successful charters are scalable to entire populations within impoverished communities. They simply don't tend to serve the most at-risk students and families.",1546483732,gimlet

acjohnson55,"&gt;It also makes me think about different learning styles and needs.  If you need strict rules, go to Success Academy; if you have other needs, could you find a school that teaches that way (like Montessori)?

That would be nice, but Montessori-like environments tend to be expensive. They're not generally available to low-income communities.

&gt;As someone who has never lived in a big city, I am curious about why the  starting condition of the public schools is so bad.  Is it just the  density of poor kids, whose parents do not have or value any education,  and can’t/won’t provide any foundation at home?

Yes -- it's the density of poverty. In my experience, the parents of my students absolutely value the idea of education. That's why they opted their children in to my school, instead of their default zone school. But too often, they hadn't experienced effective education themselves. So it's hard for me to blame the parents, because they are just yesterday's children. And then every generation, the people who can leave these communities do, and the influx of people back into the community tend to be those for whom something has gone awfully wrong in their life.

I really hate to generalize, because my students came from an incredibly diverse range of home situations. But undoubtedly, on aggregate, the amount of social issues my students had at home/neighborhood was just unimaginably worse than the aggregate situation out in the burbs. We're talking violence, sexual trauma, loss, incarceration, drugs, poor health, and everything else you can imagine. Kids are unbelievably resilient, but you can imagine that to a lot of kids on a lot of days, algebra just isn't top of mind.",1546482269,gimlet

acjohnson55,"There are actually a lot of laws in most states ensuring that poor schools have equivalent funding. The problem is that the function a school plays in a poor community is fundamentally different than in a rich community. In poor communities, schools are often on the front line of providing basic needs that are taken for granted in other places. Many students *depend* on the school for a good share of their calories. I once had a student ask if he could have part of my lunch on a Monday because he hadn't eaten all weekend. Teachers everywhere have to wear a lot of hats, but you have to wear many more hats much more of the time when your students come from impoverished communities. Doing education in areas of concentrated poverty is simply much more difficult, and that is rarely given the recognition it deserves.",1546481175,gimlet

JimmyTheCrossEyedDog,"&gt; The exclusive nature is the lottery to get in. That's the meaning of exclusivity, only a few get in and everyone else is out of luck. 

Fair - usually exclusive has connotations that only the elite are allowed in, which is not the case here. But given ""everyone else is out of luck"", you agree that these students are getting a better education, yes? I'd argue that 5% of students getting a better education is way better than 0% of students getting a better education. And the reason Success Academy has grown so quickly is to try to meet that incredible demand.

&gt; Like how public schools in rich and poor areas all use public funds... but the ones in rich areas get a lot more funds from the local property taxes (and rich areas don't have to spend those funds on things like free lunches/breakfasts for their students who live in poverty).

Success Academy opens schools in those very same poor areas - they have all the same monetary disadvantages that other schools in poor areas have.

&gt; Plus, charter schools like Success Academy get millions of dollars from private donors and education reform groups.

Fair, but they are accountable for it (they'll stop receiving it if they fail) and have apparently used it very successfully.

ClockOfTheLongNow,"The issue is education goals versus political goals.

If we were solely concerned with education goals, we would never do it this way. The research and science does not support factory learning, nor does a modern workforce need cogs in a machine.

Since we're concerned with political goals, and political goals are based around (seemingly) objective metrics, we go with test scores for measurement. Arguably a good way to achieve test scores is away from critical thinking and toward rote, factory-style learning. Higher test scores means our kids ""aren't falling behind"" and the financial investment made in achieving these scores was worth it.

In the charter sense, especially with schools in the Success model or those obsessed with academic (rather than educational) achievement, the fact that charters achieve more on a per-dollar basis is appealing to reformers and advocates alike. Since society has been led to believe that high test scores equal good education, parents sign up for these schools in droves because they believe it's the path out of poverty and/or toward successful adulthood.

If you're looking for research, long and short, you're asking the wrong question. The research could say that hanging children upside down with a blindfold on for six hours increases cognitive development, but if it doesn't show up in test scores and doesn't result in our outcomes rivaling or exceeding other countries that ""do it better,"" it won't matter.

(And we haven't even gotten into the perverse incentives created by the entrenched teacher/union interests.)

The whole system needs to be nuked, but no one wants to press the button.  People like Eva Moskowitz definitely want to try, though, and I give them credit even if they're trying to work within the broken system as opposed to people like John Taylor Gatto who spent much of his later life trying to fix it.

YoureInGoodHands,"&gt; You get that charter schools literally cause state aid to public schools to drop, right?

No, state aid to schools is exactly the same regardless of how many charter schools there are.  Aid is calculated by average daily attendance and schools are paid for butts-in-seats.

&gt; The point is that Charter schools aren't better for students, and they decrease accountability, and they decrease funding for public schools. Who benefits from public schools?

Talking about ""charter schools"" is like talking about ""district schools"", I don't know how you can generalize a school in NYC with a school in Alabama with a school in Orange County, CA regardless of whether it's a charter or a district school.  Charter schools are better for some students in some circumstances.  (Same as district schools.)  Charters are accountable to their students, parents, their board, and their authorizing body.  I notice you repeated the falsehood about decreasing funding for district schools (I think that's what you meant at least).  Repeating it doesn't make it true.  

&gt; And that they're not accountable to voters because charters don't have school boards controlling them?

Charters are accountable to their students, parents, their board, and their authorizing body.  The authorizing body is elected or appointed.  If you don't like your local charter school, write them a letter or show up at their meeting.

You're way off base if you think that there's some kind of advantage to being a poor minority from the 'hood. The tightrope a child has to walk to even have a sniff of a chance of admission to an elite school would break most children (and *regularly* does, as the series demonstrates). The hazards are innumerable. If you stack that kid up against a kid from the suburbs who fucked around but got solid grades, there really is no comparison.

And the whole argument was in complete bad faith.  Success Academy is meant to be different, so the fact that it's doing things differently than a wealthy prep school elsewhere is not surprising, notable, or otherwise a meaningful statement.  One thing clearly missing from what we heard here is whether white students within Success Academy were being held to the same standard or not, because that isn't clear from just the podcast.

YoureInGoodHands,"Eh, I'd have to listen to the whole thing again.  Charter schools pull some borderline unethical tricks at times, but they didn't hit on any of them.  Meanwhile they made a bunch of arguments that don't make any sense.  They seem to think charter schools are some backdoor funding source for billionaires, and they eluded to (and said) this several times, but failed to draw a line between one and the other.  They did the same thing they accuse the charter schools of doing, which is using a very small case study of a handfull of schools instead of looking at the charter movement as a whole.  They went on and on about one charter school in Louisiana and how they walked out.  I'd never heard of the school before but I'm sure it's not a great place.  Shut it down and move on.  They repeatedly said ""Charter schools use public funds with no accountability"" which is not true at all - not even a little.

atomicjefe,"This series is really well done IMO. It shows both sides, the yin and the yang, to a very complex topic that really pushes a lot of emotional buttons for people.

I do think it's great to see these kids achieving, but also recognize some of the challenging questions like 'at what cost?'. I don't know the answer to that, which again is a testament to the very even-handed reporting.

It does disappoint me when the discussion goes down to the comparisons with wealthier suburban white school districts. I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding of what these school districts do and don't do, how the administrations at these schools work, how much power the PTA wields and how easy it is for white kids to get into hyper competitive colleges.

We live in a wealthier school district in suburban Seattle with a very good reputation but I will tell you that the administration treats the school like a factory. This notion that all hell would break loose if they put restrictions on white kids is utter BS. The school administration and the district administration do whatever the hell they want with virtual impunity and the PTA just raises money for extra stuff.

Additionally, state law restricts us from funding our district in excess of other districts around the state. So if we wanted to pour money into our schools and make them as good as possible, we simply can't. The state restricts how much money each school gets per child and how much of the schools budget can be provided by local sources.

That being said, I recognize the huge advantage that the kids in our district have by virtue of having stable home lives, involved parents, superior facilities, etc. The thing is, though, the kids don't know this. As many times as you tell them 'you're blessed, you have every advantage, etc., etc'. They don't give a shit. Why? Because they are teenagers! I saw many kids in my son's school underachieve because they just don't give a shit and their parents can't seem to instill that in them.

And, frankly, when it comes to getting into highly competitive Universities, being a minority or coming from a disadvantaged background is an advantage. My son applied to a number of highly competitive Universities and didn't get into any. I mean, what could he say on his essay? 'I had every advantage and underachieved anyway. Let me in because I have good grades and SAT scores.'  Nope, not gonna cut it and I don't blame the schools. Look at Harvard's admission criteria that has been exposed recently. I find it very pragmatic. Minorities (except Asians) get a boost. Students from challenging or interesting backgrounds get a boost.

These minority kids in Success Academy have better chances of getting into these schools than white or Asian kids. And I'm not judging that. I just think it should be recognized as such. Universities are looking for diversity. And don't buy into the notion that the kids can't afford it. Many (70+) of the most prestigious universities offer full financial aid to accepted students. For poor students, this means you can go to that University even if your parents have zero money.

My point in saying this is just that this information should be out there. These minority kids should be aware that now is a tremendous opportunity for them to excel in academics because of how the Universities do their admissions and financial aid.",1546025201,gimlet

glass_hedgehog,"I want to see how these kids do in college. This American Life did a story that followed a young man when he went to college on a full ride scholarship via the Posse Program. He was an excellent high school student and very smart, but even with the financial support he almost failed out of college because of how overwhelming it was, and nothing had prepared him for that. He couldn’t afford a book for his class and he didn’t know what to do so he began failing. And then he felt like he couldn’t ask for help because he was supposed to be this very smart kid who could figure things out on his own, so then he kept failing as he didn’t ask for help. And it created this cycle and by the end of his first semester he was in danger of loosing all financial aid. 

The metric of success that SA uses shouldn’t be whether or not the kids get into college or how good the colleges they get into are. The metric of success should be whether the SA graduates do well in their chosen colleges. Obviously we don’t have that data yet, but I don’t think we can really say that SA “works” until we see how many of their graduates successfully make it through college. I’m especially concerned because kids who come from a hyper controlling environment like SA often spin out of control when suddenly given more freedom like that offered in college. College isn’t going to track attendance and give warnings. I’m curious to see if SA’s tactics translates into strong self-motivated work ethic in the long term. ",1546018992,gimlet

I was hoping that someone would've asked whether Moskowitz or any of the board members had spent time with the children after school. That was the point of Chow's question... The after school stress of Chow's question wasn't pointed to after school activities, it was home life. I guess Moskowitz either 1) actually recognizes this, and her solution is to ""power through"", or 2) she sees it and is minimizing the problem and influence a troubled home has on kids, or 3) she is oblivious to it completely. Regardless, it seems like she needs some cultural awareness/sensitivity training of her own to better understand and address the issues if she is truly seeking to improve the kids performance and in reality their lives.",1546017488,gimlet

There was some brief mention about the state, and I myself am dubious about whether the state will get a good value for their money, but there is almost no way the village can end up being worse off.  A substantial part of what is presented as a cost is a counterfactual in which Foxconn or some other company is imagined to have moved to the area without being given any tax benefit.  Giving up some tax revenue that you don’t have now anyway is not a real cost in an area where the trend is for businesses to leave.

The actual funding done by the village contains protections.  The village makes infrastructure improvements; these are guaranteed by the state, so worst case it costs the village nothing and they are now more attractive to other businesses.  The rest of the money borrowed by the village is guaranteed by Foxconn; worst case Foxconn doesn’t meet their commitments and increased tax revenue is inadequate then Foxconn pays the difference.  There may be some people in the village that didn’t want to sell their property even for substantially above market price, but I don’t consider this to be so bad.  There are many cases where eminent domain has been used to buy land at prices below market rate.",1545958592,gimlet
Meanonsunday,"Also it was strongly implied that OLED provides better image and is the future of TV technology.  This is a substantial exaggeration;  subjective opinion on image quality is split evenly and OLED has issues with lifespan and burn-in as well as being more expensive.  At this stage of the technology OLED seems more likely to end up going the way of  plasma.  Maybe microOLED will be more successful, but right now what makes LCD plants obsolete is limitations to make larger LCD panels.  It would have been more accurate to focus on whether Foxconn is committed to building a nearby facility to provide the larger glass panels that will be needed as TV sizes continue to increase.",1545957305,gimlet

Crippling anxiety can stop you from starting a difficult task, but once you prove that progress can be made, that problem goes away. No, this is really just a person who doesn't want to make any sacrifices in their own life, even when it's a comparatively negligible sacrifice for how important it is. Seriously, it's the only proof of your best friends' wedding... if it's not crippling anxiety, how do you not dedicate a weekend to it and crank it out?

When Alex is showing his friends for the first time, he starts to say ""I havent..."" and then cuts himself off. I'm pretty sure he was going to say ""I haven't heard this yet"". This super-important thing with his best friends, and not only does he not actually \_do\_ it himself, but he doesn't even take half an hour to listen to it.

He doesn't clarify to his friends, either. He doesn't say ""Actually this isn't important enough for it to eat up my time, I delegated it to my employees"". He takes all the glory, and he doesn't even thank Jonathan for his work on this, or invite him to dinner afterwards.

I want to be charitable, so maybe this is just the edit? Eg. maybe he did thank Jonathan profusely and explain to his friends, but that part was cut out? Although I can't imagine why the editors would make the CEO of their company look like such an asshole if they didn't have to.",1545669985,gimlet

The reality is that as someone who has attempted journalistic endeavors, I’m aware how hard it is to tell stories and good podcast makers do it way better than I can.
However, this branded content model just seems counter to how most content’s effectiveness is ranked (popularity whether in viewership numbers or tickets sold or whatever the case may be) when we say that the branded content is not judged by listenership by the companies they work with.
In other words the consensus here is that it’s a form of content production that has metrics different from what I’m used to hearing about.",1545589101,gimlet

xLNBx,"Two side notes:

First, a pet peeve :) It's never ""*just* be paid to tell good stories"". I don't want this to sound like hard criticism, it really is more of a gripe - but in my view to say ""just"" in a professional context betrays how little people know about the process and, as result, how easy they think it is. It's like going to (enter any profession here) and telling them you *just* need an (enter whatever they do here). They have skills and experience they have perfected over time, they use tools and techniques you have no idea about. So to say ""just"" is short selling what they do. If Nike or Coca-Cola came to me and said they ""just need a story told"", not only I would do precisely that (how hard can it be?! c'mon...) and I would also add ""look how much cheaper I am than these Gimlet guys!"" - but I also guarantee my podcast would be terrible in all kinds of ways. Rant ends here :)

Secondly, this is frequently not the case:

&gt;little oversight

There's often a ton of oversight and the amount usually grows with the size of the client. Higher stakes, obviously, but also frequently, a higher number of people in the organisations who need to justify their role by providing feedback (even if they have little knowledge of what they're talking about - you can imagine how I know this). So *there is plenty of oversight*, but how popular the final product will turn out to be is not a top priority concern.",1545576845,gimlet

The main post is here [https://www.reddit.com/r/gimlet/comments/9ghol3/cracking\_mystery\_show\_did\_anyone\_catch\_this\_what/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gimlet/comments/9ghol3/cracking_mystery_show_did_anyone_catch_this_what/)

The bit about Vienna from that write up. 

&gt; Work had begun on session two, which was to consist more of listener  submitted stories (all the stories from season one began from people she  knew personally). One of these was a reddit post about a guy trying to  find the artist of a song he’d recorded off the radio when he was young  in Austria and had a big impression on him. She had gone to Vienna and  spoke to the radio DJ who aired the songs, and had big ambitions on how  to draw out the original musician. During this period she’d also  attended an artists’ retreat to work on other stories and define a  direction for the second session.

pm_me_hedgehogs,"&gt;Good day, Alex and PJ. That place you were talking about, I'm calling from it now. Physically I'm in a place called the Mullum Mullum Trail walking over a wooden bridge, faded planks, you can probably hear the birds. It's Melbourne, Australia sort of in the outer suburbs and I'm leaning on the wood and I'm looking over at a, at a creek. 

&gt;But the place I'm in is because I've just been running, and I’ve been running every morning because I'm waking up with this emptiness, this loneliness, this loss in my stomach because three weeks ago now my son was downstairs, he's fifteen, he was fifteen. And he was downstairs, playing Fortnite probably and he came upstairs and it was a Saturday morning and he said, ""I'm feeling a bit dizzy."" And we looked into his eyes and his eyes were going all over the place and he said he started to feel numb and he was losing his balance and he sat on the couch. And I held him while my wife called ambulance. And we spent two weeks in a intensive care unit at The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and he was unconscious and on life support. 


&gt;And after two weeks of testing and everything like that, they identified that his–it wasn't really life support, the treatment they were giving him was really just prolonging his death. And so last Sunday that was removed and my fifteen-year-old son died on the 4th of November. This is a very lonely place. It's a very difficult place. I've been referring to it as the Upside Down. My son, Collier, loved Stranger Things. And this is exactly–it exactly feels like that. It's the world–it's the same world, it's just remarkably different. And it's remarkably darker and it's a bit scary because I don't know what happens next. Thanks. ",1545466901,gimlet

Literally the first thing he does is go to an online forum of random amateur nutjob ""investigators"" and then take up with the first guy to message him, and he treats it like this ""Holy shit, am I really going to investigate this? This guy is the *expert* on this case! Wooooah!"" moment. I had to shut off the episode on the spot, it was so fucking bad.

doryphorus99,"Good question. To me, the pillar of Gimlet's business seems to be its ability to create and tell stories. That makes for a powerful engine that will create valuable IP that larger entities will pay for and capitalize on (e.g., Homecoming becoming an Amazon original, or Startup becoming Alex Inc). Meanwhile, the siren song for corporate marketers seems to be CONTENT! and that's where Gimlet excels--creating compelling content using their storytelling craft. The podcasts are just one outcome of that, but they can become so much more. As another poster pointed out, I doubt the corporate marketers are much concerned whether the podcasts are a hit. It's just another way for them to get their brand out there and feel like they're telling their story in a good way.  I think Gimlet is succeeding because they are applying a truly high-level, professional focus to podcasting, an area rife with amateurs, and that makes them stand out way above the crowd. As long as they continue to hire top talent that can generate and create compelling content, they will succeed. I wouldn't be surprised if, in the near future, they're acquired by a larger media conglomerate looking to get into this relatively new space.",1545328094,gimlet

Until you live the downside that inevitably comes with extractive industry your alleged knowledge is meaningless to me.

glass_hedgehog,"Your point two and three conflict with each other. A big reason why puberty blockers are so important is because they stop the kid from experiencing the mental anguish of going through the puberty of the wrong sex. Also it is much, much easier to transition and successfully pass as your desired gender if you never went through the wrong puberty.

I highly recommend the book [Becoming Nicole](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Nicole-transgender-actor-activist-extraordinary/dp/0812995430) which follows the Maines from her birth through her transition in a family where her identical twin brother and mother supported her, but her father did not. It follows all the steps Nicole wanted and did take as she transitioned, including her finally gender reassignment surgery after she turned 18 and after her dad came around and began supporting her. Some of the most striking chapters are about Nicole watching her brother going through male puberty and being terrified, depressed, and riddled with anxiety. Its very powerful.

I do agree with your first question though. What makes it not a mental illness? I'm not really sure we can answer that question without knowing what specifically within our brains dictates what gender any person, cis or trans, dictates our gender.

SophieTheCat,"&gt; Starting businesses is what all really creative people do!

I don't know that he said this verbatim.  Show me and I'll eat my words.  And I don't think he was trying to insult non private sector professions.

There is definitely nothing wrong with working in the public sector - lots of super important research has been carried out there that propelled the human race forward.  Nonetheless, if you think about people who have affected our lives the most in the last 50 years like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, etc... all started businesses (and therefore channeled their creativity through it).  

It doesn't have to be a zero sum game.  The various sectors of the economy compliment each other.

&gt; What makes it NOT a mental illness? I hate the phrase mental illness because it implies judgement. But simply a symptom that can’t be physically seen or tested that can cause mental distress? The DSM 5 still has gender dysphoria included by the way. But not explicitly transgender.

The explanation I've heard is that mental illness requires intervention to bring the mind in line with the rest of the world, e.g. treatment to reduce schizophrenic hallucinations. Being transgender, on the other hand, may require medical intervention to bring the body in line with the mind, e.g. hormones or surgery. There isn't anything 'wrong' with the person that therapy or SSRIs or anti-psychotics could fix.

&gt; Why did the podcast encourage puberty blockers at all? Kids have wild imaginations and their understanding of sexual identity is underdeveloped. For most at least. Surely it makes more sense to let the kid get through puberty first and then let them seek further insight into whether they still feel transgender and then take more definitive steps. This should be a decision with a specialist anyway.

I thought the episode addressed that, and did encourage parents to seek specialists. I'd encourage you to check out the citations for that section--using puberty blockers on trans kids is something that comes up often enough in media discussions of trans issues that I think it was worth addressing.

&gt; There was a real lack of discussion on mental comorbidities such as depression, personality disorders, anxiety, drug abuse and schizophrenia. Suicide is an important one of course and thanks for mentioning it. More of a point than a question.

Can you help me better understand what you mean here?

&gt; What do you mean by gender identity in this podcast? 

These kind of questions are super important! Let me try to take them one at a time. Gender identity means, basically, that when we close our eyes and ignore our bodies, most people *still* have a sense of what gender they are: a boy, a girl, neither, both, something else entirely. This is why, if a man or woman lose their genitalia, they still know they're a man or a woman. Likewise, there are ways the body can have hiccups around hormones and/or chromosomes, which means (for example) a person might have XY chromosomes and produce regular levels of testosterone, but their body can't process the testosterone correctly. This person would develop female anatomy in the womb, have F put on their birth certificate, and (almost always) *identify* as a woman. But a genetic test still might show XY. So we know gender isn't genitalia, and gender isn't genetics. Gender identity is the nebulous idea that gender lives *somewhere* in you, even if we aren't 100% sure where, and that the only way to be absolutely positively sure what someone's gender identity is....is to ask them.

&gt; Does gender identity here mean transgender people want the opposite sex’s body parts AND/OR they want to look, act and appear like the stereotyped image of the opposite gender? I know it sounds judgy when I type it but I don’t mean it so. I just feel that the definitions need to be cleared up.

Gender identity means that internal sense of your own gender. Being transgender is when someone's gender identity is in conflict or out of line with what their body says. I'm a transgender woman, which means the doctor said, ""It's a boy!"" when I was born, but when I was older I was able to say, ""Mmm, no. I'm actually a girl."" In my early 20s, I medically transitioned, which means I went on hormones (and hair removal and eventually some surgery) to bring my body in line with what I already knew: I'm a woman.

But every transgender person's experience of being trans is a little different, just like there's no One Real Way to be a certain race, or from a certain place, or practice a certain religion.

&gt; If a transgender person desperately wants their penis removed, what makes this different to a transabled person who desperately wants a healthy limb removed? 

Because the former works, and the latter [just doesn't](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/evgn84/when-you-have-body-dysmorphia-coping-through-plastic-surgery-can-be-a-nightmare). 

&gt; Also aren’t we past having stereotyped man and woman roles? I don’t understand. I have zero idea.

Yes! Totally! Buuuuttttt....let's look at gender roles a little more zoomed out. No woman should *have* to be a housewife, for example, but it's OK if someone *chooses* to be a stay-at-home parent while the other works. No man should *have* to enjoy rough-and-tumble sports, but it's OK if some do. Similarly, I know women with short hair and long hair, men who are attracted to women and some who are attracted to men (or both or neither). And I know some *transgender* women with short hair and some with long hair, and some *transgender* men who are attracted to women and some who are attracted to men (or both or neither). 

It true that, sometimes, some transgender people go to extremes of gender, becoming either super masculine or super feminine. Sometimes that's because it truly fits the person, and sometimes it's probably because they feel pressured to confirm in that way; that it's required if they want to be a 'real' man or a 'real' woman. 

In my perfect world, yes, there would be a lot more room for people to live outside of stereotyped gender roles. But I still would have transitioned because I would still be transgender, even in that world.",1544893786,gimlet
bodaciousbecca,"I enjoyed the episode, and agree with the approach it took. I also think you make a good point. 

I do think there's a difference, though, between less than one percent of a specific population and less than one person of *everyone*. I don't know (and couldn't find with a quick Google search) what is considered successful when it comes to other courses of treatment. 

Back to your original point, I heard the introduction using common to mean 'occurs often enough in the general population that it's silly to consider it ridiculously rare or unusual,' and the later use of 'less than one percent' to mean 'a low enough failure rate of a course of treatment so as to be medically legitimate.'

I mention this here because at the beginning of the episode, half a percent was converted to a number to argue how common transgender is. At the end of the episode, ""less than one percent"" is used to argue how few people regret transitioning.

I get trivial base and all that, but the purpose of percentage is to *help* mitigate that. A large test study that shows .5% of something, even if the number is large, is still not seen as common.

I'm not saying that the number of transgender people isn't potentially a big number. But it's not common when it's .5%, and it's not intellectually honest (imo) to use it to call something ""common"" (or ""not rare"") and then use less than a percent to call another thing ""uncommon"" -- especially given that ""common"" and ""uncommon"" are both terms of relativity.",1544889953,gimlet

And instead of looking at what works, the debate is instead surrounded by lies of charters being private schools and complaining about a public school getting public funds.

She mentions that they lose about 10% of their student body every year.  That 10% is more than likely low performing students, students with behavior issues or students who don't have engaged parents.  So, every year, they get to lose the 10% worst performers.  Those students have to be absorbed by public schools.  

Does that explain the huge discrepancy in test scores? No.  But if every child who has an engaged parent (which they need to to even get into Success) goes to a charter, you realize that you're losing the students who public schools most need.  

So, you already have a selection bias (the kiddos who got into Success have engaged, aware parents who are willing to push their children) and then they get to say things like, ""Maybe this isn't a good fit.""  
That public school principal does NOT get to say that.  They have to accept everyone.

I think the more important question is: Is Success scalable? Could it take over all NY public schools today and have nearly the success it does here? No.  Because that kiddo who was standing and walking around in class would have to be kept.  The kiddos who performed less than 80/100 would have to be kept.  ",1544823229,gimlet

Second, what do you care I could be a genius that doesn’t need to study. If I can do it just pass me and don’t hold me back a grade because of these really subjective measures.",1544821998,gimlet

SophieTheCat,"&gt; I definitely already knew this from the story itself

I really didn't.  It was vaguely mentioned in passing, but the huge emphasis was given to Sean pleading with the village council, not able to understand why this was happening to him.

It's possible that I am overstating the case a bit by using terms like ""screwed over"".  I just don't know enough about the family dynamic.  

However, the whole thing just doesn't pass the skeptical smell test for me.  Think about this...for one, nothing is stopping the mom from giving Sean the portion he is owed.  Secondly, just on the face of it, $54k for relocation several streets down for a single person - doesn't it seem outrageous?  Last time I moved, my entire cost was the $2k deposit for a new place and $50 UHaul truck, and $100 for movers for 2 hours.  Moving costs for 5 people - sure, I can make the case for it, particularly since Sean is in a wheelchair.  But not $54k for a single person.    ",1544819112,gimlet
MasonJack12,"I totally agree. The only indignation I felt during this episode was listening to Lisa attempt to frame the narrative by cherry picking a few people who had bad experiences.

Sure, that one example of the girl having an 80 average didn't sound great, but are there are statistics to back up the claim that Success Academy pushes out low performers?  What if that was 1 mistake out of hundreds fair and reasonable decisions?  Find me the best companies in the world, regardless of what they do, and you can still find a few discontents.

What exactly was the point of comparing the public school with a 20% pass rate? It would be one thing if they had an academic success rate that rivalled Success Academy. Then you could at least claim that academic success can be achieved without being so structured. But the take away here is what? Sure, they can't read but at least they aren't required to sit up straight!

It seems to me that Gimlet is attempting to paint Success Academy as controversial, and I just don't see it. Families enter a lottery in hopes of getting in. Test scores are superior to the alternative of public school.  So what's the problem? That a small fraction of students don't thrive there?  As with anything else in life, you can't please 100% of people 100% of the time.",1544817678,gimlet

This was a tough listen for many reasons, one of which is how Gimlet is choosing to position the skepticism of the promotion and achievement goals. I know this is not the kind of education I would want for my kid (but I'm also extremely skeptical about testing on a whole and my issue is more with education in general), but if you came into this with zero knowledge, a strong disconnect exists between the amount of time spent on stories where this model doesn't work for kids and families and not a lot with the successes and how Success could open 50 more schools tomorrow and still not meet demand.

To your point #1.  Fair. 

Point #2. Alex. Both sides of the story were mentioned, you are right. But one was an emotionally charged outburst of man in obvious pain and the other a dry statement of a govt official.  I am sure you could see the difference. 

I think the story needed a bit more nuance regarding why Sean was asking for money if his mom already received $54k of moving assistance + 140% of assessed value of the home (so $266,700 according to https://www.xome.com/realestate/12305-braun-rd-mount-pleasant-wi-53177-118215924?hv=1).  Imo, the village should go after the mother and get Sean paid. 

One more thing...if either Alex or Shruthi could clarify.  At the village meeting when we hear Sean - is he aware at that point his mother is the one who screwed him over? Is he aware now?  What is his mother's take on this?  If this hasn't ruined their relationship, why can't the family continue to live with the mother at the new location?  I feel like there is a lot more to the story.

And yeah, I don't mean to imply that one needs to be a Tea Party Trump supporter to support the Foxconn project, just that it seems more likely that that would be the case for many people. But I agree, in previously industrial areas, you don't have to be associated with any particular political party to want industry to come back. And that also really annoyed me about Sruthi's reporting- the Great Lakes region famously had a lot of industry, especially steel made from Appalachian coal, but in the 1900s the Industrial Belt became the Rust Belt. There has been a pretty large decline in manufacturing jobs in the Rust Belt since the mid to late 1900s. Sometimes people in areas like that don't have a lot of options, so welcoming a factory sounds like a good one even if it means neighbors losing their houses. There's a lot of history in the Rust Belt, it's pretty patronizing and insulting to just insinuate that the village council is gullible.

As far as being pro foxconn, I don't think you need to be pro Trump or tea party or any party really - as was mentioned during the episode - manufacturing jobs dried up - so rather than work at Walmart or something like that - why wouldn't you want a place that hires for skilled manufacturing jobs with upward mobility. 

Another thing that really annoyed me was Sruthi trying to score points by saying they might not be manufacturing LED panels but something else and that it somehow dooms the whole project.  Did anyone expect foxconn to be manufacturing same technology for 30 years In this day and age? Factories retool all the time.  Same Sharp, Samsung and LG factories that were making LED screens for the iPhone 8 and lower for the last five years are now making OLED screens for iPhone Xs.

squeekypig,"Thank you for posting this. I also thought Sruthi left out too much in her 'reporting', and I don't think it makes you a conspiracy theorist for pointing that out. I understand that there's a time constraint obviously because it's a single podcast episode, but it was still an hour long (longer than usual episodes!). For an hour long episode she left out some pretty important things, like:

* What you posted- it's not the Village that owes Sean the money- it's his mother for lying on documents about her number of tenants/residents. It sounds like the village informally knew Sean existed, but on official settlement paperwork he wasn't included by his mother that he was renting from. Sounds like her fault, not the village there.
* What was the council's basis for calling the project area 'blighted'? This was a pretty major 'plot' development and it wasn't explained at all. According to WI law an area can be considered blighted if it's crime rate is a certain amount higher than surrounding areas, so maybe the crime rate is actually high there? It still sounds sketchy, but because the village used this as the basis for moving forward I think it deserved some explanation. All Sruthi said was that blighted meant ""it’s unsafe and uninhabitable"", and that  one trustee ""has pictures of the houses, they’re beautiful properties, obviously not blighted"" which is disingenuous if blighted means high crime rate. You can have a high crime rate and still have houses that aren't run down. (She could have also included comments from a MN property lawyer whose firm works in eminent domain issues- he said that the village is abusing eminent domain)
*  At least a tiny bit about who owns that website/blog. Sruthi led us to believe it's DeGroot who started the website. Apparently Alex looked into and didn't find anything but why not say that in the episode? Obviously it's run by someone who is at least pro-DeGroot, but surely there's other people in the village who are pro-Foxconn development? It sounds like something that people who identify with the Tea Party or Trump would like, and there's probably some of them in that town of *26,000 people*?

It's an interesting and really sad story, and I am definitely sympathetic for the townspeople, but I don't really think this was an example of great reporting. Good storytelling, maybe. But not reporting.

It's an uncomfortable reality that school quality varies incredibly, and an ideal solution would be to make every school better, but their doesn't seem to be a political will to do that.",1544400409,gimlet

MasonJack12,"I know there has to be some tension or controversy  as part of the startup narrative, but I found this episode to be a real stretch.

The big complaint in this episode was that the growth of Success Academy was resulting in inexperienced staff who couldn't handle kids who didn't fit the mold. Yet, at least in the example they used, that Success location had close to 100% kids pass the state test while their public school counterpart was at 0%.

Even if you accept the idea that Success weeds out the problem kids, which in turn helps their scores, Success is still clearly more successful when it comes to academic performance.

The former teachers were criticizing how Success was not flexible enough to handle kids who didn't thrive in their educational model. The one guy who was getting all emotional when talking about ""the greatest number of good for the greatest number students"" made my roll my eyes. His big problem was that you are leaving kids behind.  If you have 1 disruptive student who makes learning difficult for the other 29 students, what should the school do? Change the curriculum and style of the school?

There is an old adage that you can't please 100% people 100% of the time. And that seems to be true with Success Academy. But it hardly feels controversial when cherry-picked former teachers say they didn't like how the way kids had to sit quietly (gasp!) or that it was unfair that trouble makers who flipped desks got the boots.

As Eva so astutely pointed out, Success is not perfect, but for many NYC kids, the alternative is the failing public school system. 

I've debated a friend for years about the idea that we are largely a product of our environment. He says that he worked for everything he has, so if a poor person doesn't want to be poor, they can too. But without an opportunity to get an education, I don't care what race you are...your chances of success are much worse. Success Academy is likely changing the course of thousands of lives. These kids would likely end up stuck at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder if it weren't for Success Academy.  

Any criticism of Success Academy is minor relative to the good they are doing. The tests scores bear it out. The fact that their waiting lists are thousands of names long prove that the communities they serve also recognize the amazing life-changing opportunity that Success Academy provides.",1544352220,gimlet

His family did not actually own the property, instead his mother did and the family was living with her and paying her $500/month rent.  When the mother sold her house to the village, she neglected to mention that she had tenants, so presumably all the money went to her.  The village provided Sean and his family a place to live rent free to make it good, I guess. But no $22,000 that he was promised before the village  realized that him and the mom would be double dipping.  So yeah, Sean was screwed over, but more so by his mom than the village.

I think the main crime is leaving fuckers behind and allowing their own citizens to be hurt during any of this process. With that kind of money, there's no reason to screw a disabled guy out of 20 grand.

It reminds me of the recent GM closure announcements. They're probably gonna close a factory in Hamtramock, MI.  A factory that used eminent domain to kick loads of people out of their homes. It just disgusts me that people can be ousted from their ancestral home, the land that they earned and owned, just for some temporary factory that is being built with #1 purpose being to benefit a company.

silriven,"Yeah, I was basically thinking exactly this.  I think we should be careful about disregarding test taking skills and the general knowledge that you need to have to do well on those tests as not ""useful shit"", especially when those test scores are frequently what kids, especially ones from disadvantaged areas, get judged on when college entrace time comes around.  If you're coming from a lack-luster school or even one that just doesn't have good ""brand name"" recognition (like a technical high school or some other fancy private school with a history of producing students that do well in good colleges), like it or not good test scores and taking extra tests like the AP Subject exams play a significant factor in getting noticed by college admissions offices.  It's just an unfortunate fact right now that test taking skills ARE useful in terms of getting you where you want to go, but it doesn't have to be that way.  In this case, I think we should be asking colleges and other admissions departments why they place such a high value on test scores rather than why institutions like Success Academy dedicate so much classroom time to test prep.  Success Academy is reacting to the situation and designing their curriculum to meet the standards colleges ask of students.  Taking college admissions tests aren't cheap, either, you have to pay to take the SAT and extra AP exams, it's very clear that these tests are a type of class gatekeeping in addition to an educational one, but colleges still expect that from applicants.",1544186252,gimlet

&gt; When the writer, radio producer, and humorist Jonathan Goldstein set out to create his Gimlet podcast, “Heavyweight,” whose second season concluded on Thursday, he considered introducing each episode with a subway P.A. system that would talk to him like the voice of God. 

&gt;. . .

&gt;The subway-voice idea, he thought, could be both funny and thematic, like Mork talking to Orson. But it was too elaborate. Instead, each show begins with Goldstein calling an old friend, Jackie Cohen, who banters briefly, laughs at him, and hangs up. It’s like a microcosm of the show: Goldstein acts like an entertaining noodge, makes something happen, gives us a laugh.

They got an exception to pull 7 million gallons out of the lake every day which is a lot for a single site.  A lot of that water (\~4 million gallons/day) will be reintroduced as treated wastewater. The problem is that the waste that this kind of plant produces is bad and it will probably have an adverse affect on the lake an the wetlands the factory will sit on.

The transformation is complete at the heated meeting.  He finally understands that he doesn’t have to listen to anyone, when he can shout them down and threaten them with arrest.

We did this to ourselves and we’ll be pulling ourselves out of this disaster for the rest of our lives.

The one who has regrets (about his failed novella, about his destructive criticism) is Jonathan, and he's the one who's forced to grow through the progess, not the usual protagonist.

WikiTextBot,"**Picaresque novel**

The picaresque novel (Spanish: picaresca, from pícaro,  for ""rogue"" or ""rascal"") is a genre of prose fiction that depicts the adventures of a roguish, but ""appealing hero"", of low social class, who lives by his or her wits in a corrupt society. Picaresque novels typically adopt a realistic style, with elements of comedy and satire.  This style of novel originated in Spain in 1554 and flourished throughout Europe for more than 200 years, though the term  ""picaresque novel"" was only coined in 1810. It continues to influence modern literature.

userd,"I would put Heavyweight in my top 10 all-time podcasts but this episode is one of the worst podcast episodes I've ever heard. It's like the anti-Heavyweight. A normal Heavyweight episode is where Jonathan attempts to heal a long-standing wound or scar. In this episode, it's like Jonathan has Munchausen syndrome by proxy*, and he insists that someone has a wound and then proceeds to pick and pry at that person's skin until he draws blood in the hopes that he'll be able to pat them on the head and tell them, ""Jonathan's going to make everything ok.""

You could argue that the wound he is attempting to heal is his own, but it's clearly not worth the amount of rudeness needed for that.

&gt;Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP) is a mental health problem in which a caregiver makes up or causes an illness or injury in a person under his or her care, such as a child, an elderly adult, or a person who has a disability. ",1544131338,gimlet

I want to believe that the council has the best interests of the community at heart and I guess the issue is whether who is acting malicious (getting paid for their vote in some way) and who is acting in good faith (really believing that Foxconn is going to make a positive impact on their community).

arrrg,"I think the idea behind that is that you will just eat more if your exercise more – and it doesn’t take a lot to eat all the calories you lost. A slightly larger portion, one coffee with milk more, a couple more nuts, etc. Humans aren’t scales and horrible at estimating how many calories something has.

Especially in the context of a seven minute workout it’s easy to make up the calorie deficit (which is often well less than one hundred calories, which is less than what a small Latte Machiatto from my office coffee machine has).

Obviously if you were to precisely control the calories you take in and kept that constant you would lose weight if you are more active, however we are talking about less than one hundred calories and even if you are very diligent in counting calories you will have a very hard time being all that precise. If you don’t even count calories but just go by feel … forget it.

I do actually incorporate exercise in my weight loss routine, but more as a reward. I have a daily calorie budget and if I exercise that limit increases.

I don’t, however, think that makes me faster at losing weight or anything, I think it might make me slower, but it’s good to be active, independent of any weight loss.",1544093901,gimlet

&gt;Spotify isn't a podcast app. It's Pandora, with the addition of podcasts.

No, it's not Pandora. Pandora doesn't let you look up and play individual songs. Pandora makes machine-chosen playlists based on songs or groups of songs you feed it. You are correct in that Spotify did not start out as an app for podcasts, but neither did iTunes, and they added podcast support to that in 2005. I will also concede that compared to apps dedicated to playing podcasts, Spotify is severely lacking in functionality. 

&gt;I'm pretty sure Apple is the OG Podcasts app.

I couldn't find a definitive source on which app was the first podcatcher, but it certainly wasn't from Apple. As I stated above, Apple made it possible to find and listen to podcasts in iTunes in 2005, but podcasting started before that. Apple didn't release it's standalone podcast app until 2012. 


&gt;The rest are all third-party apps.

Any app not made by the maker of the OS is third-party, so it's not really relevant here. 

The issue is not whether you have to have a third-party app, it's that you have to have a specific app, and I agree, that sucks. I have Spotify, but I like Pocket Casts way better for podcasts.

In the case of private schools, I don’t think they even need to be held accountable to the states metrics for funding.  In my public school, it was common knowledge that doing poorly on the state exams meant less money for the school, which is ironic considering that poor academic performance is probably a symptom of there being a lack of resources in the first place.

That's a good point. I'm not sure how China is so different from any other country. If the US government serves Google with one of those ""do what we say and don't tell anyone"" commands.

I don't get how it's greedy to want to provide a search service for Chinese people even if it's censored and tracked by the Chinese government. I see it as

a) Google builds Dragonfly with censored tracked search. Result: Chinese people have a choice between Baidu (censored+tracked) and Google (censored+tracked). Assuming Google's search tech is better than Baidu's this is still a good thing for people in China

b) Google does not build Dragonfly. Result: Chinese people only have Baidu (censored+tracked). They don't benefit from Google's better search and services.

My point is there's a way to look at this that's not just about greed. It is better for Chinese people to have access to Google than not.

Surtur1313,"&gt;What if the ""they"" in the ""they couldn't have done it"" is just referring to humans?

When discussing who built the pyramids if you say ""*they* couldn't have built them"" you are talking about the ancient Egyptians. You may mean ""humans generally speaking"", but specifically you are referring to the humans known as the ancient Egyptians. And to then say that they couldn't have built them is to deny all evidence in favor of a series of provably false assumptions.

Honestly, at this point you're just searching for some way in which it isn't racist to deny that the ancient Egyptians could have and did build the pyramids. As I've already said, it isn't necessary for those who participate in this sort of pseudoscience to be ""I hate black people"" type racists, but perpetrating the notion that these people couldn't have possibly built the pyramids is indeed racist.

Surtur1313,"To be clear, the individuals who support a theory that ""aliens must have built the pyramids because the ancient Egyptians certainly couldn't have"" aren't necessarily overt racists, in the ""I hate black people"" sense, but they are absolutely making a racist assumption in doing so. To deny all evidence and instead opt for ""they couldn't have done it"" is inherently racist. There is nothing to suggest the ancient Egyptians were backwards or lacking in intelligence or ability, nor is there anything to suggest they didn't have the tools required. Suggesting to the contrary is a result of racist assumptions about what those in ancient Egypt or in areas with similar ancient megalithic structures were like.

Yes, some of these people are likely caught up with all of this pseudoscience because of their fascination and desire for there to have been alien contact. However, the only manner in which this is possible is to reject all evidence and assume that those who actually did build the pyramids were incapable of doing so, an assumption that is inherently racist. ",1543614612,gimlet
OctopusPopsicle,"I personally don't give any credence to an ancient alien theory; I was just trying to view it from a different perspective, one that doesn't have racist undertones.

Sure, by not accepting the evidence that proves they were built by humans. Are they undermining the hard work and time that went into them because of racist ideas? Not so sure. However, I can see why some people can see that based on your article. Like they mention at the end of the episode though, some people are just caught up in the fascination of it all and like the idea of aliens visiting Earth.",1543614064,gimlet
Surtur1313,"&gt;I think people that entertain the ancient alien idea just thought it was such a huge feat to be accomplished during a time when few tools existed

It is a huge feat, no doubt, but there were plenty of ingenious tools and  methods, alongside countless people involved in every aspect of building these structures - from those who did the manual labour to those who designed them and implemented the tools necessary and every person in between. To take away from this achievement by suggesting it only could have been aliens is to deny the incredible work done by real people and to deny the very solid scientific archaeological work that has demonstrated that they have done so. It's favoring a racist assumption over basic reality and scientific consensus. 

&gt;Maybe they just really want to believe aliens exist and this is their way of making that connection.

This isn't a good way to validate a belief in aliens, at all. There is literally zero legitimate evidence for a theory of ""ancient aliens"". If you believe in aliens, and believe they've visited earth, you're doing yourself absolutely zero favors by trying to tie aliens to the construction of the pyramids. It's nonsense of the highest order. ",1543612817,gimlet
OctopusPopsicle,"It's a good article, thanks for sharing. And now that I've finished the episode, they speak on this a bit towards the end. This is also the guy they interviewed in the podcast. The idea of it though, that the theory is racist, seems unusual to me. I can see why this one guy would definitely have some racist ideas behind it based on his comments, but overall, I think people that entertain the ancient alien idea now just think it was such a huge feat to be accomplished during a time when few tools existed, not necessarily with racist ideas backing it. Maybe they just really want to believe aliens exist and this is their way of making that connection. ",1543611771,gimlet
Surtur1313,"&gt;I have never heard this before, that the aliens building pyramids theory is racist, has anyone else?

Yes, I have, and yes, it is. 

Here's a solid and extensive article on the topic, ""[Pseudoarchaeology and the Racism Behind Ancient Aliens](https://hyperallergic.com/470795/pseudoarchaeology-and-the-racism-behind-ancient-aliens/)"", written by Sarah E. Bond, who is an Assistant Professor in Classics at the University of Iowa. It provides sources and is a fairly decent look at the history of pseudoarchaeology and the notion only aliens could have built structures like the pyramids. Basically the original proponent of the idea was a fraudster and racist, who couldn't get his book published until a literal Nazi author rewrote it and used his connections to get it to press. Throughout the book there are plenty examples of severely racist assumptions and statements. When it comes down to it there's also just zero legitimate evidence for any of it, not to mention the exceptional volume of evidence that shows the pyramids were built by humans and how they did it. It's basically a racist fraudulent tale spun to discredit the achievements of real humans in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

JimmyTheCrossEyedDog,"&gt; So exactly like the Eisner quote? 

No, I don't think so. The Eisner quote, as I read it, says the goal is always money - it may just so happen that, due to market forces, making good content can be a path to making money. But some people want to make money solely so they have greater ability to make good content, and more of it. I think Blumberg falls into that camp. This, of course, still means he needs to heavily consider money in his choices. It may even mean that the end result is not much different between a money-guided and content-guided mindset*. But it means the intentions and the deep-seated goals are different, and I think that's still a relevant thing to consider.

*in this case I think the outcomes would be very different - look at podcast networks like Earwolf, where their shows are almost certainly way cheaper to produce and probably get similar numbers of listeners. If Gimlet was purely money focused, I don't think shows like Reply All would exist - they're sustainable, but not huge profit machines.

&gt; Nothing on the scale of any Mystery Show episode. 

I would disagree, but without knowing the intimate details of how much producing podcasts costs, I don't think I would be able to convince you otherwise, so agree to disagree here.

&gt; Maybe someone high up at Gimlet was part of canceling Mystery Show because they thought it was a bad show, but I've never met anyone that thought it was a bad show and the statement from Gimlet made it sound like they did not think it was a bad show. The alternative is that it was a good show that was too expensive or otherwise difficult to make. 

Those aren't the only two options - there's plenty of other reasons to cancel a show. The fact is we just don't have all the information, and probably for good reason.

There's a few that have a bit of evidence for them. I don't claim to know very much about Starlee so I don't want to wrongly disparage her, but based solely on her responses to the cancellation, some even years after it was cancelled, it seems like she may not be the easiest person to work with. She also had disagreements about the advertisements on the show - that certainly could have contributed. I don't know, and neither does anyone beyond the parties involved, but they're perfectly reasonable explanations.

There's also alternatives I have no evidence for but are perfectly good reasons to cancel a show. Maybe she wanted to take Mystery Show in a different direction that the producers and editors did not agree with. Maybe she did a very bad thing (I won't give an example because, again, I have no reason to believe she did - it's just an alternative explanation). Again, none of these things necessarily happened - I'm just saying you have no better idea than I do, and there's plenty of alternatives, so you can't so assuredly pick one.",1543563095,gimlet

Nina Jacobson has almost nothing to do with all the movies she claims to be part of.

It would be like interviewing Kaz Hirai or Ken Kutaragi about how they made successful titles like the Uncharted series or God of War series, or Bill Gates on how he made Halo. In all these cases those people had absolutely ZERO influence on those projects and similarly Nina Jacobson had nothing to do with most of the projects she's attaching her name to.

It's a huge disrespect to the teams of people that actually spent or years making those projects that she'd take and or get credit for them. At most she green lighted them. It's the talented people that made them that deserve all the credit.

JimmyTheCrossEyedDog,"&gt; I'm not sure Alex Blumberg would love the comparison

He hosted an economics podcast and started a for-profit company - I think he's well-aware of this. That doesn't mean he only wants to make meaningful art because it can sometimes be profitable - it can just as easily mean he wants to be profitable so he can continue making meaningful art.

&gt; Heavyweight is far cheaper to make and production can happen on a shorter timeline.

Any evidence for that? Heavyweight has done some incredibly ambitious and time-consuming stories, and the team have probably scrapped a ton that just didn't pan out like they'd hoped.

edit: also

&gt; It's a place where Mystery Show, the best show on the network, can be canceled because it's too hard and too expensive.

gudfader,"&gt;I would disagree - it's not news, it's not informative. It's just a story, one which happens to be nonfiction.

Journalism comes in many different genres and doesn't just equals news. And because it's nonfiction it means it involves real people that you have to treat with a certain responsibility. 

&gt;Even regarding actual journalism I would disagree that a journalist necessarily must call out a source - when you quote someone, you're not saying that what they say is true, you're reporting that they said it.

You have an enormous power as journalist when asking questions and afterwards in the editing process. Especially in these kinds of stories. Heavyweight decides the direction of the story and isn't just quoting. There are big editorial choices in play here because as a listener you are left with a message or moral so to speak.

&gt;Telling her, or even just the audience, that she made a bad, maybe even immoral choice and it's her fault she's in this mess works toward none and against several of those goals.

It's not about telling her or the audience. It's about what conclusion and message you are left with as a listener. And I would argue it's very much in the favor of Rachael. And yes the goal of the podcast should be closure, forgivness etc. But for what price? Should we accept a woman taking away a fathers right to his child and vice versa because ""she didn't feel like it""?  It seems mad to me, to end the story in this manner. ",1543282840,gimlet
liz_zitrone,"She wasn't the greatest interlocutor, was she? Two things stuck out in particular: her refusal to engage with how lessons learned would apply to the past and her bristling at being asked about working with her husband. Her reactions came across as cop-outs. 

Yeah of course you don't live in the past but you really can't play around with the idea of how the wisdom of today would inform decisions like those you had to make in the past? 

And with all due respect, Alex is interviewing you alone, so it's not exactly fair to complain about how your ex wouldn't be asked the same question. Especially when your interviewer is someone who speaks a lot about that very issue, despite being a man. That said it's always interesting to see how pros handle subjects that are a little challenging.",1543279570,gimlet

I would disagree - it's not news, it's not informative. It's just a story, one which happens to be nonfiction. So I wouldn't call her a source, but

&gt; you should always hold your sources accountable for their statements and actions

Even regarding actual journalism I would disagree that a journalist necessarily must call out a source - when you quote someone, you're not saying that what they say is true, you're reporting that they said it. That's what most low profile journalism - the facts, without editorialization (but again, not all that relevant here because I don't think this show is particularly journalistic)

So I stand by my original point - criticality and unbiasedness are not the goals of the podcast, and in this situation they would be entirely antithetical to the actual goals - closure, forgiveness, healing, and a deep exploration of one person's particular emotional turmoil. Telling her, or even just the audience, that she made a bad, maybe even immoral choice and it's her fault she's in this mess works toward none and against several of those goals.",1543275821,gimlet

It's a story being told with different parties and in an extreme case like this, you should always hold your sources accountable for their statements and actions. I feel like the show tries to excuse the behavior of Rachael with laughs and irony - as Jonathan always elegantly do - but this woman's case is just too serious. Yes, you are allowed to make your own conclusion in the end, but that conclusion  will always be based on what has been put forth by the journalist - in this case Jonathan - and in my opinion it has been brought deeply in favor of Rachael.

Plus, while they briefly touched on his controlling behavior, they probably didn't want to attack his character in detail just in case he gets involved some day. It's possible their relationship gave Rachael the information she needed to know he wouldn't take it well. Instead of focusing on that angle, the podcast may have made it about Rachael's anxiety to spare Oscar and Lena the record of his bad behavior. 
 
I don't want to attack him either. People are flawed and capable of change. Being a shitty boyfriend 10 years ago, having a drinking problem, and being rude about the phone call don't mean he's irredeemable by a long shot. 

From a distance, it's easy to see Rachael's error in neglecting the subject. But I can easily imagine 10 years of not wanting disturb a situation that was functioning. Why introduce this other element when things were going well the way they were? Or at least that's how it seemed to Rachael, not knowing her daughter had questions. And now she sees that she was wrong about that.

Also these people aren't celebrities inundated with internet feedback all day. So it's somewhat likely that Rachael will read these comments.

coolnmellow,"I see such hate and vitriol for the church as an organization. People swear it was always a horrible idea and only serves to oppress women and LGBTQA folks. You must look at human nature, and I wish people could just be honest about this. Just 20 years ago, no country had legal same sex marriage. Not Christian, not Muslim, not Jewish, not irreligious, not one. As recently as 2009 55% of Americans opposed it. There was just a near universal sentiment that it was unacceptable from the indigenous forests, to the irreligious, to the Christian Jewish and Muslim nations. Women have been fighting for equal rights since the 1800's in America. While we've never had a female leader, India, Egypt, Liberia, England, China, Central African Republic, etc have all had them and some of these places have atrocious human rights records and archaic views on women. What I'm trying to convey here is that religion isn't this evil thing that makes countries go mad and oppress minorities, women, and gays. We do that all by ourselves. Countries with religion outlawed (communist Russia, China, N Korea) have led the world in nothing when it comes to human rights or even progress. The absence of religion has never been shown to make a place better, more understanding, or even more progressive at all - ever. So the notion that taking down the church will magically bring a wellspring of relief, comradery, and acceptance is false. If anything, the decline of religion correlates to the rise of debauchery and/or decadence which tend to be indicators of a great fall. ",1542742281,gimlet

Who's looking out for the rights of the kids to have a peacful lunch period, especially the ones who are on some kind of aid program and depend on the school for free lunch?  The students don't get that benefit.

It's not really surprising that Success Academy had a lot of issues in its first year, they're trying something different, but they seem to be very invested in their students in a way that a lot of established schools, teachers, and administrators just aren't.

&gt; This time, it was an infestation in the company’s third- and fourth-floor call centers at 294 Washington St in Downtown Crossing. The bed bugs issue, which has reportedly been a problem since April and continues to plague the company’s Boston offices, was the tipping point for SimpliSafe workers.

-

&gt; Each member of the workforce BINJ spoke to claimed that the company’s management engages in racial and sexual harassment and discrimination. In the most egregious instance, a worker says a white supervisor made a comment to a black subordinate implying that he could rape her because his family had owned slaves in the past.

-

&gt; “Chemicals were sprayed,” said Costello, to fix the infestation. But workers say they were told neither of the extent of the spraying nor about the chemical used by the exterminators. The company had staff in the office the next morning. That reportedly led to workers feeling ill. One of Costello’s fellow call center representatives, a pregnant woman, spent the beginning of her shift vomiting from the toxins.

-

&gt; Soon after, people started getting interrogated for their involvement with the petition, a practice known as “captive audience meetings.” Costello sees the interrogations as intimidations in violation of US labor law, designed to produce a chilling effect on the staff. And the threats were real, said Costello, who told BINJ he had seen people fired for standing up against racism and sexual harassment from both supervisors and customers.


And did you really read the [other article?](https://digboston.com/macro-aggressions-trump-flags-right-wing-memes-line-walls-at-boston-company-workers-be-damned/)

&gt; According to a United SimpliSafe spokesperson, supervisors at the call center are majority white and treat their subordinates of color with dismissive and abusive language. In one instance, a white supervisor allegedly said to a majority black and Latin team, “I’m like a slavemaster and you’re my slaves.” 

-

&gt; “Anyone who openly disagreed was a target,” Jeromski said. “If they found out you were opposed to Trump, you might find a Pepe on your desk.”

-

&gt; “They are absolutely creating a workplace in which people from numerous marginalized groups would not feel welcome, or even safe,” Bojak explained. “The person supervising that employee should be taking action as soon as possible.”

-

&gt; Jeromski described a workplace where people of color didn’t advance and the white managerial class maintained white hegemony in professional and social settings. Nonwhite workers wouldn’t receive recognition for their work, Jeromski said, and were frequently passed over for less experienced white workers. And nobody would talk to them.

The whole idea is built on call and response, rout memorization &amp; 100% compliance. It's great for creating order and high MAP scores, but not for inspiring children to be life long learners, self motivated or be particularly good at reasoning.

PM_ME_MICHAEL_STIPE,"It *should* be hard to fire someone from their job. The average teacher in America makes about [$50k/yr,](https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/average-teacher-salary-in-every-state#) which is on par with the national average. This means that being without a wage for even a couple weeks can be devastating. [78% of workers claim to live paycheck to paycheck, after all](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/24/most-americans-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html). 

I don't work in education, so I don't know the specifics of the issue, or what they are talking about with the scenario of the principal having to take on a teacher that shows up out of the blue. Interestingly, we don't get to hear about it at all, even though the person arguing with Eva was clearly trying to get across the nuance of the issue and got railroaded instead. 

It is easy to be mad at bad teachers. I think that it is more important to look at systems that disincentivize good performance, things that disincentivize good applicants, and things that keep our best teachers out of bad schools. The problem there is not that workers have too many rights. 

Teachers use those lunch periods to get caught up with their other duties so that they can get home to their families and their lives. Teachers work [12-16 hour days during the school year.](https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2013/08/how-many-hours-do-educators-actually-work) Monitoring the lunchroom may seem trivial, but it is just one duty among many that can pile up and make the work day endless. A well-funded public education system would be able to maintain a staff size large enough to ensure that the lunchroom could be handled without having to add to teachers' workloads.

CozyAmigo,"Haha no problem. Podcast fans, at least the ones on reddit seem to be ridiculously hard to please. They want well produced, interesting long form content but they want it every week and they don't want the quality to drop. Most want it for free (not all as some like yourself will donate or pay for ad free episodes) and are angered by releases on premium platforms even for a limited time but don't want to listen to too much advertising. And now complaining that a company that currently has over a dozen active original podcasts is somehow ""only"" making sponsored podcasts. 

There seems to be a complete lack of awareness that different types of content take different amounts of time to produce. That an interview is different to researching a story for 6 months to make an episode. And a very narrow definition of what a podcast is and how it should be distributed. I've encountered ""Podcast should be regular content"", ""Podcast aren't for binging"", ""podcast shouldn't be fiction that should be left to audio books."" Who created these rules? why can't producers release podcasts in whatever schedule works creatively and economically. 

Similarly to you there are choices Gimlet have made that I am not a fan of, there are shows gimlet makes that I do not like but there is quite a lot of what they produce that I do like. I listen to that and if I run out I go and listen to some of the other great podcasts out there. 

And if people feel like they can't do that, if this frustration is borne out of not being able to find a comparable podcast after they have finished a gimlet season, people need to ask themselves why that is. Maybe the show is hard and/or expensive to make. Maybe gimlet's business model is what makes it possible. 

 I guess my main thing is I wish people would stop being so hyperbolic. Stop asking if things are dead or gone and stop acting like gimlet only cancels shows because they took VC money when the truth is those shows would probably have never had existed without that money.   

At times people act like they still have to tune into their wireless. The content is on demand, it automatically downloads to your phone. Take a breathe, everything is gonna be ok

It wasn't ever a specific group, it was just a common ground between various political ideologies who could all at least agree that they hated fascists and would fight them together wherever they showed up.

Like you said you wouldn't put the emphasis on the 'ti' part of antidote (or antibiotic or antihistamine). The prefix 'anti' doesn't have one syllable emphasized over the other so saying 'an-TEE' is awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

Heavyweight never claims that the subjects of their episodes are blameless, but simply ask that the listener empathize with the subject and their situation.

Not so much by commenters here but by Jonathan himself by choosing not to cast any critical lens on her whatsoever for just choosing to deny her child a father for 10 years, and Oscar the right to know he was a father for 10 years. Yes, in the *extremely* limited anecdotes we hear about Oscar, he sounds like kind of a dick, and getting three DUIs (years after the fact) certainly isn't a feather in anyone's cap. But the idea that those things justify not telling a man that he's got a daughter for 10 years is insane. And Jesus, even more so, the kid's own right to know she has a father, and to have a relationship, ANY kind of relationship with him.

And why, exactly, do we hear that she didn't tell him? Welll...she was busy. She was stressed. She didn't like him anymore. LOL, seriously? 

All that just flew right past you, Jonathan? I was waiting for the obvious questions to at least be asked, like: Didn't you feel Oscar deserved to know he had a child? Didn't you feel like your daughter had a right to know she had a father -- let alone, you know, have a relationship with him? You just decided that she got zero fatherhood in the first 10 years of her life because you didn't want to look him up and tell him?

I have been a donor to Radiotopia and I have for years, so I love them, but this attitude treats everything in the podcasting space as a zero sum game. What is especially frustrating to me is the apples and oranges comparisons people make between entities like NPR, Gimlet, Radiotopia, Max Fun, Slate, PRI, etc - they all have different advantages,  business models, funding strategies, and relationships to their content creators! People treat them all as if there is no distinction between networks, production companies, distributors, and so on - as if the only difference between Gimlet and Radiotopia or NPR is that Gimlet is private and the latter two are public.

Of course, the other big question is - why are podcast fans, especially of the sort who complain about this, so entitled about getting (generally) free content? Whether if its with Gimlet and their shows having a for-profit model, or with The Adventure Zone fans complaining about the focus on touring or the release schedule, so many podcast fans seem to be fixated on the idea that the producers and creators who make the media they so enjoy shouldn’t be allowed to make money off of their life’s work by choosing different ways of making and distributing their shows.",1542321785,gimlet

I’m sure Jonathan must be lovely but, to me, he’s not funny or interesting enough for this kind of storytelling to work well. 
I kept skipping his comments to get on with the story, which only seems to increase in the recent episodes.

Hope the podcast finds a pleasant balance in the future.",1542311325,gimlet

It's made by the same guy who made Missing Richard Simmons. Part of me can't shake my impression of him as being a bit disingenuous, remembering how he claimed to be Richard's ""friend"" as he trampled all over his privacy for the sake of making a viral podcast.  

The new show is pretty good so far, though I do wish it were hosted by someone else because of my negative associations with his voice.  The stories of survivalists, religious end-of-the-worlders, etc. are interesting!  But the casual-buddy tone just feels fake to me.",1542248044,gimlet

INVESTIGATIVE:
- Serial
- The city: amazing host tackling corruption, environmental inequality and waste management in Chicago in 1990's
- Believed: the story of how Larry nassar was able to abuse so many girls for years.

STORYTELLING:
- Radio ambulante. There are very few podcasts in Spanish, and this team of people are amazing at uniting Latin America through stories. (Recommended for people how what to practice Spanish) 
- The cut on Tuesdays: love the host, and the topics that have been discussed.
- Thrist aid kit: since buzzfeed has chosen to close its audio division, I wonder what will happen to all the shows they created that make me smile and laugh in the train.
-Heavyweight: Johnathan is so nice and funny, he manages to tell the stories that talk about deep feelings yet he infuses them with smiles.
- Without fail: I love all the conversations, feels like a great podcast after startup.

environote,"I'm not a security or technical expert, so I'm sure there's more to it than this. But my understanding is that password entry is either encrypted or doesn't leave the local device during login. It's unlikely that the password would be ""hacked"" and much more likely that if someone got into the manager it would be the result of end-user error: using the password on another service, writing it down, or using a common password are all reasons that come to mind.

Nothing is 100% secure, but remembering one password to secure many others is preferable. I'd recommend using password generator to generate a random and complex password, then memorize that one and use it for the manager itself.",1542226401,gimlet

Some people feel the high tension level in NYC is due to this condition. Physiologically,  light energy waves bouncing off the building to create an image in the brain come back to quickly. That is why wide open spaces in the West or at the beach are soothing. The brain has a chance to process the energy to images more leisurely. ""Give me land, lots of land, under starry skies above.
