* John Hodgman
* The McElroys
* Jonathan Coulton 
* Will Wheaton
* Patrick Rothfuss
* Mega Ran
* A bunch of other awesome people.

I know the Judge didn't mean that veterinarians are ""con artists"" but that term gets thrown into vets faces very often lately. There is an epidemic of suicide in the profession and some of it is from abusive clients accusing vets of doing unnecessary procedures to charge extra money. Sometimes this involves hundreds of people cyberbullying and mobbing veterinarians' social media outlets. 

So please tread lightly with this sensitive topic. Most veterinarians are very ethical and try very hard to work with clients regarding cost.",maximumfun,A request about the DC JJHO show...Trigger Warning

EccentricOwl,1569606074,"In ***Hunter Gaveler***, John Hodgman made the ruling that one should never take a photo with a celebrity, as that makes them feel like a piece of entertainment. Further, he argued that it shouldn't be allowed if the celebrity's children are present, that it shouldn't be allowed at all. Finally, he argued that if it is a ""public space"" like a restaurant, it is also impolite and unacceptable. (As far as I can tell, you can only do it if it would be polite to tell someone that they have a bat in their hair, and you lean over to say it while waiting in line at the urinal.)

&amp;#x200B;

A friend in Los Angeles is fairly sure he saw Flophouse peach **Elliot Kalan** semi-recently, but did not approach him because he thought it would be impolite. 

On a similar note, Star Trek podcaster Benjamin Ahr recently mentioned ***BEING ON AN ENTIRE PLANE FLIGHT SITTING NEXT TO STAR TREK LEAD ACTOR JOHNATHAN FRAKES*** and never saying anything. These two combined make me curious if I understood the ruling right. 

 Finally, I was curious if this ruling still stands, or if five and a half years have adjusted this declaration on celebrity contact. There are a *lot*  of great **JJHO** episodes, so I don't know if it's ever come up again.",maximumfun,Does the honorable Judge John Hodgman's ruling on talking to public figures still stand?

I so appreciated what Jesse said about migraines in this episode apropos of a dispute about transporting Ibuprofen in pockets. 

I am also a chronic migraine sufferer, and have experienced all of the dismissal and doubt that Jesse rightly noted often arises from the fact that migraines more commonly affect women (like myself). Migraines can cause debilitating and seemingly intractable pain. It's awful and having that experience minimized or recast as a psychological issue rather than one of physical pain makes the problem exponentially worse. I felt very seen by Jesse's discussion, and hope that it encouraged others with migraines or other chronic pain conditions to keep trying to get help. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this is a thread to 1.) say thanks and 2.) open a space for anyone who might have questions about migraines to discuss. I, like, Jesse, once got migraines nearly every day, but over time have been able to find treatments to make them much less frequent and more manageable. I would be happy to talk about what worked and what didn't (though that's different for everyone), and to just offer some commiseration and encouragement.",maximumfun,"Niles and Dobbs, July 10 2019, Bailiff Jesse talks migraines"

shinecone,1556761360,"I want to say first of all that I post this question from the perspective of a huge MaxFun fan and monthly supporter for several years. I love several shows, MBMBAM and Judge John Hodgman primarily, also listening to Wonderful, TAZ, and Friendly Fire, Sawbones. One of the things I appreciate is that all of the hosts I listen to on MaxFun seem really committed to opening their minds, learning about diversity and acting respectfully towards those who have different perspectives, especially those whom society has typically not given a voice.

&amp;#x200B;

But earlier this year, I noticed listening to JJHO during one of the guest bailiff weeks (I think Emily Heller), it was so good and interesting to get a female perspective on the show. And listening to episodes of Friendly Fire, there was one episode about the movie Heaven and Earth so they spoke a lot about the perspective of Vietnamese women in war, and I thought about how valuable it'd be to have a diverse perspective on the show.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm getting at is that most of the shows I listen to on MaxFun are hosted by straight, white men and some women. Not a bad thing, necessarily- like I mentioned earlier I'm a huge fan and admire the hosts- but I know that Jesse and the employees at MaxFun are committed to diversity, so I was wondering if you guys could help point me to some shows on the network that have alternative or minority hosts or viewpoints, whether gender, ethnicity, race, sexuality, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know Minority Korner is an obvious one I need to check in to, but I just wanted to get some feedback from fellow MaxFun fans on the shows they enjoy that also feature a little more diversity. Thanks guys!",maximumfun,Diversity on MaxFun?

I recently got into MBMBAM via The Adventure Zone, which itself was initially suggested to me by the Stitcher app's promotional features. I'm going through the archives, and boy howdy does it feel like roughly a quarter of all their content is exhorting people to sign up for the MaxFun Drive. I know it's not *actually*, I probably just feel guilty because I'm not a paying MaxFun supporter. But when I pay for Stitcher, is no part of that payment going to MaxFun to license their content? Is MaxFun giving up the goods for free, allowing Stitcher to make money off it, then just begging for more?

ribks,1553217643,"SO here's the dilemma - I had and cherished my zag on em pin so much, that when my boyfriend and i travelled from toronto, ontario to new york to see MBMBAM live i of course brought it with me, but on the subway on the way to the show it must have snagged on someones coat and i lost it. I had a small emotional breakdown about losing said pin, and i've been wanting to get a new one ever since. 

With maxfundrive happening now (and me being in a financial place where i can afford to donate again) I was planning on joining at the $10 tier and wanted to know if anyone maybe would trade a pin of their choosing from this year for the zag on em pin??? I can also happily pay for one if you have a spare you're selling for a reasonable price!!

this pin meant a lot to me because my boyfriend and i started dating kind of because he introduced me to the show and it was one of the first big things we bonded over, so i would love to have one again. 

i know it's kind of a long shot but if anyone can help me out it would be amazing!!",maximumfun,"Is anyone holding onto a ""Zag On Em"" pin and can male a dream come true??"

However, now that I'm experiencing it live for the first time, I have to say, it's a lot of fun!

enalios,1550782483,"tl;dr - are the sound effects and mocking tone confined to the Ozarks UFO investigation or did the whole show used to be that way? When did it stop? 

I'm pretty new to Oh No Ross and Carrie, though I've been hearing about it for years in ads. 

Jordan mentioned the Urine therapy episode he was going to participate in and I figured that would be a good jumping in point.

I also listened to the Teal Swan series, the recent psychics and aura photography episodes, went back to the two part recap episode they did a while ago, and also went through the entire Rhythmia series. It was awesome!

However what I liked most about everything I heard is that they are skeptical, scientific, but not mean. Well. Occasionally mean, but it's so so rare and usually just during the wrap up - and I acknowledge I'm probably just more sensitive than most.

So I decided to go even further back and I just started the UFO convention in the Ozarks. Now, I could be doubly sensitive here because I live in Arkansas but... 

What the hell happened?? Carrie's got morning DJ *sound effects*? They're totally shitting all over these people! Like, just making them the butt of jokes. Not to say that they're bad or wrong to be doing so - it's just really not my thing. 

Is their entire back catalog like this? When did they shift to being less openly mocking? Did anything prompt it? When did the sound effects go away? Is it just this investigation that's like this?

Again, good show, good people. And everyone is allowed to shit all over whatever they want - I just don't like it so I'm wondering how much of the show is for me, that's all!",maximumfun,Ross and Carrie back catalog tone/sound effects

The studying techniques they describe are TORTURE when you're 8 years old and you just want some fucking homework help. The reason there are nuggets of truth in LRH methods is because he stole from actual brilliant people. Not because he's a genius.

NathanRMartin,1546785927,"Meet my two most recent foster cats, Chip Dipson and Dip Dobson. Technically they came into the adoption program as Chip and Oreo, but I'm not a fan of on-the-nose color-based names. When I decided Oreo needed to become Dip the rest was history. These 10-month-old brothers ended up evicted from their home when a new baby turned out to be so allergic that the family had to get rid of all of their pets. We decided they were a bonded pair, and needed to find a home together, but their first two weeks of family-shopping at the PetSmart adoption center were unsuccessful. I took them home to my place over the holidays, gave them their new JJGo-inspired names, and after two weeks took them back to the store yesterday afternoon. Within 10 minutes of arriving they were already sitting with a potential new family, and less than hour later they were adopted and on their way to their new home. I'm pretty sure they won't be keeping the names in their new lives, but I'll always have fond memories of the brief time we spent hanging out.

Fellow Emmy nominated editor/podcast host/great guy Chris McCaleb joins us on the couches this week. And Chris brought his own drops! 

We talk [to] Chris's co-worker Mike Bearmantraut, how Chris started in the tv business, and we take half guesses at the isolated drum tracks that Niel found. Jonah sends in a piano jam from the road. 

Be sure to check out Chris' podcast [The Better Call Saul Insider podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/better-call-saul-insider-podcast/id966297954?mt=2), and watch his work on the amazing Better Call Saul [Lodge 49](https://www.amc.com/shows/lodge-49) and [Patriot on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Patriot/dp/B017APUY62)

We are going to be banking some episodes in the coming weeks for when Jonah goes on tour with MST3K, so if you got something you want us to hear, you want to yell at us or need that patented “Big Neil Energy” to push that creative project across the finish line, hit us up at names o’ the show at gmail dot com.

Also, that story about the Beatles having a knuckle shuffle group meeting came out after we recorded, so we don’t touch it.

stogie-bear,1534081678,"I'm going way back in history here, so this is just for posterity, but I'm the brother from [Judge John Hodgman 190: Pizza Parley](http://www.maximumfun.org/judge-john-hodgman/judge-john-hodgman-episode-190-pizza-parley) and I only just listened yesterday. My sister never mentioned it after the fact, and at the time I was busy with other things and completely forgot that Meredith and Jason were doing it.

The facts of the fantasy football incident as Jason and Meredith presented them were incorrect in several key points. If I'd been called as a witness I would have cleared some things up. I remember this all quite well, because the game in question - the first of the 2009 season - was my first fantasy football game ever. I don't know why Meredith didn't remember the incident better, but memory is weird and the facts of the incident were undoubtedly less important to her than the followup.

But anyway, here's what happened. 

To review how the incident was presented in the show: Meredith was the commish of a fantasy football league that included me, her boyfriend Jason and a bunch of other people she had brought together. Through some computer quirk or mistake, an erroneous scoring category was introduced, which nobody knew about and which caused me to unfairly beat Jason in the first game. An argument between me and Jason ensued, which Meredith settled by agreeing that if Jason conceded, she would let him choose the pizza toppings for life. She did this because she thought that if the argument continued I'd tell my grandparents that's Jason is a jerk and she'd never hear the end of it. Since then, she married Jason, which means that she's lost her pizza freedom for life.

That's not quite it, actually. My key points are:

**1. The hidden rule ""mistake"" was not a mistake and it was there for anybody to see**

I had played a lot of fantasy baseball and knew a lot about fantasy sports and how to draft, etc., but had no familiarity with the customs of fantasy football. This meant that I didn't know that a defense was supposed to be unimportant and the last or second to last thing you drafted, even after backup RBs and WRs. It also meant that I took a careful look at the scoring settings of the league before the draft (because I knew that this would be important, and I didn't know anything about fantasy football scoring) and I knew that points would be awarded for return yards. It did not occur to me that this was unusual. 

When I prepared for the draft I used some online tools to project how many points should be scored by various players, and I put a high value on defense/special teams (because the return yards points meant that you could expect 30-50 points from D/ST, which seemed to me at the time to be the way it should be, because D/ST is at least half of a football team). I targeted the Steelers D/ST, which was the class of the NFL at the time, and took them in a high round. 

That scoring setting was not a mistake. Meredith set up the scoring system with help from Giff, whose name is mentioned once in the episode. They're both very smart people, Ivy League graduates, who are certainly competent to decide on some scoring rules and set up league settings. They did tell everybody that they had introduced changes from the defaults - the nonstandard settings were not generated by computer glitch. They were there, visible to all of us, for at least a week before the draft, and in the discussion that followed the controversial week's scoring Giff remembered turning on return yards as a scoring category without thinking about the side effects. What I'm saying is that **Jason had notice that return yards was a scoring category and if he'd been more careful he would have adjusted his draft like I did.** 

Since I was not a skilled debater, I didn't catch the trick when Jason characterized the scoring setting as a ""mistake"" but in the JJH episode it sounds like a mistake where somebody clicked something incorrect and nobody else noticed - conflating that type of ""mistake"" with Giff's ""mistake"" of not considering the side effects of the scoring rule.^1

**2. At the time it was not at all clear that Jason actually should have won**

After the games were played, I was pretty damn happy - I'd won my first fantasy football game ever! Jason was upset and complained about the system, and others agreed that using return yards as a scoring category was odd. 

We put it to a vote and decided that the scoring would be changed from now on to remove return yards from he scoring, which I agreed to (grudgingly because it meant I had overvalued D/ST in the draft, but I didn't make a big deal out of it). What nobody expected was that because Meredith entered the rule change after the NFL games had been played but before the scoring week had ended - maybe it was Tuesday or Wednesday, I forget - the changes applied to that first week and the outcome of that game was flipped.

I was pretty unhappy about that. This is where the argument started. I was probably not very mature about it. Jason was a recent national champion of extremely-fast-talking debate and I hadn't been to law school yet, it annoyed me that somebody with vastly superior debate skills was using them against me like this to create an unjust outcome. At the time it was clear to me that we had played the week under rules we all knew (or would have known if we'd taken the time to read them) and the results should stand. In sports, midseason rules changes are made sometimes, but they never have the effect of changing scores of games that were already played. When the governing body of F1 racing made Ferrari's side mirror design illegal earlier this year, Ferrari had to change it for the next race but they didn't lose the points they scored before the rule change.

I wasn't the only one who thought that. The league members were divided. Giff was pretty firmly in my corner and there were others who chimed in on both sides but nobody really wanted a piece of that argument.

**3. About that grandparents thing**

Look, we all have our input filters. Meredith remembers times when we were kids and adults sided with me and thinks of it as a pattern and I remember all the times she got gifts of My Little Ponies for no occasion and I got nothing, or she started trouble and I got blamed (making that happen was her favorite hobby when she was 3 or 4). But I wasn't going to say anything to them and even if I had it wouldn't have made much difference. 

**4. About that crazy pizza deal**

At the time I thought that what Meredith was agreeing to was that when the family-plus-Jason was together, for the rest of that NFL season, he'd choose the pizza toppings and Rock Band instruments. We didn't even live in the same state, and it wasn't clear when or whether Meredith would bring Jason home, so this would affect one or two meals and a few hours of video games at most, and since it was only when the ""clan"" was together it would harm me as much as her. (In retrospect it would have worked out well for me, because I'd want Jason's pepperoni and mushroom pizza and not Meredith's mustard pizza.)

Although I agree with Jason inasmuch as mustard pizza is a travesty and nobody should be exposed to it against their will, the deal they did make is crazy and completely not worth the fantasy football win. The win was important at the time because it was my first one, but really it's not a big deal. Therefore, **I concede. Jason can claim victory in the game. Meredith deserves her mustard pizza.**

Footnote^1 

To say that the scoring ""rewarded bad defense"" gets the scoring of that fantasy game wrong. He had the Giants D/ST and I had the Steelers. The Steelers won their game that week allowing 10 points; the Giants won their game allowing 17. In the original scoring of the fantasy game, with return yards included, the Steelers D/ST outscored the Giants giving me the win; in the amended scoring, with return yards removed, the Giants D/ST would have outscored the Steelers even though they'd allowed more points in the NFL game, because of the other scoring metrics for D/ST.
