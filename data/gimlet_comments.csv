Also, if it’s not relevant (doesn’t add value to the story), then you’re just applying your bias or leaving room for others to apply a stereotype, so I leave it out.

crusaderblings2,"I had the exact same reaction. I listened to the one with his dad and uncle, and then that one and it left such a bad taste in my mouth it turned me off from the show for a bit.

He just sucks. It's hard to put into words, and I know it's what Jonathan kind of tells us at the start. He's...how do I explain....

I was in a fraternity in college. It was a tech school, so it was this wide split of anti-social nerds and bros. I was in the fraternity that was kind of in between. During recruitment, when someone on the far-bro side of the spectrum showed up, they'd see it wasn't for them and leave. But when someone on the far anti-social nerd side showed up, good lord it could get bad. We were extremely accepting of anyone, and so to these people who were bitter and cynical, they got attached to it, but they were still bitter and cynical. And we could never quite describe them.

Before anyone suggests it, it's not autism or aspergers. One of my closest friends growing up had aspergers. While he lacked social grace and reading jokes or sarcasm, he always had a good heart, that's not what this is about.

These kids, you get two or three a year, not combative, per se, but they won't make the conversation easy. They're not cold or quiet, because they still talk and make their opinions known. But you and I know how talking works, we know (in general) beats to hit, there's a rhythm and they refuse to play to it out of need. In improv, there's a rule called ""Yes, and"" which is that if one person says something either unexpected or even unwelcome, doesn't matter, you accept it and roll with it, but that concept works for everyday social interactions too. There's so many things Gregor says where you're like .... why would you say that? I'm listening to the episode as I write this to remind myself how much I hate him. He just mentioned how he has two beautiful children, or rather only one of them is but he won't say which one. What a weird thing to say. Or other times where there's a very obvious thing to say and he just refuses to. It's late and I'm drunk and I'm now rambling more than I expected but bear with me.

Then the strangest person came in and nobody knew what to do with him. I hated interacting with him but I didn't hate him. I had no issue with him on a conceptual level, but I didn't want to talk to him or be in the same room. We couldn't find the word for until one day I described him as ""abrasive"". It struck so perfectly. Not aggressive, not outright shitty, just...sour. Complete lack of warmth, but not cold either. Somehow no personality and uncomfortably too much personality at the same time. From that point on it was the only word we used to describe those types of people. Like neckbeards but less bigoted.

Gregor reminds me of those kids. Gregor is abrasive.",1579936506,gimlet

We just don't have anywhere near enough info to judge him as a human. And doing so is kind of missing a lot of the point of Heavyweight. People are imperfect.

baldnotes,"&gt; I want to avoid getting into the ethics and morality of eating meat, as I already know that's what your rebuttal will be based on. 

This whole discussion if you want to have it is about the ethics and morality of the production of animal products. It's not necessarily about eating meat or using animal products in general.

&gt; Are you really unable to determine the difference between purchasing and consuming meat as an end product for the purpose of sustenance, and straight up physically abusing your pets for no tangible gain?

Of course there are differences and nuance. But what question are you asking exactly? The questions I am asking are about animal welfare, necessity and profit. I will sum up my objective in three questions:

- Is common mass meat production inhumane and causes large-scale animal suffering? The evidence clearly shows this is the case.

- Is it necessary to uphold this type of meat production for the purpose of providing sustenance? The numbers obviously speak completely against this. In terms of calories produced and energy used, meat production is extremely wasteful. Again, I am not talking about the general morals of consuming animal products.

- Is the profit mechanism of the industry tied to the suffering of the animals? Yes, industrial animal product production is mainly set up in a way where animal welfare is of almost no concern because making it a concern will increase prices. And that starts way before we are even talking about gestation crates.

What this YouTuber did with her animals is incredibly cruel to me, no doubt. I think profiting of putting animals in cages and filming them for how cute they are is pretty sick in its own right. But if we look at suffering in the grand scheme of things, her addition to animal suffering is what? A trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of 0.00000001%?",1579809838,gimlet

I want to avoid getting into the ethics and morality of eating meat, as I already know that's what your rebuttal will be based on. My argument here is more along the lines of determining the mindset of a person. And buying a cheeseburger isn't an indication of an abusive and/or sociopathic personality. 

Collecting ""pets"" that you don't have the capability of properly caring for so you can get some attention on the internet. Physically abusing those ""pets"" *literally* while filming your videos and editing those parts out (except when you accidentally don't — whoops!)...

There wasn't really one. Or at least not explicitly. Of course the internet is an undercurrent in all our social and political lives at this point, and at one point in episode 3 there was a videochat involved; but that was sort of about it.

If that isn't really your thing then I would steer you toward either 'The Guardian's Longreads' which are essentially just audiobooks of their best reported/written articles.

WikiTextBot,"**Free File**

Free File is a service available through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which allows U.S. taxpayers to prepare and e-file their federal tax returns for free. Free File provides two options to tax payers: Free File Software (filed through brand-name software, adjusted gross income must be less than $66,000), or Free File Fillable Forms (any income level, filed through online fillable forms). Both the Free File Software and Free File Fillable Forms services are managed and operated by the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private tax-preparation companies. The service is available through the IRS's website at www.irs.gov/freefile.

***

**Free File Alliance**

The Free File Alliance is a group of tax preparation companies that collaborate with the Internal Revenue Service to provide free electronic tax filing services to United States tax payers meeting certain guidelines. The Free File Alliance claims that the program benefits American taxpayers by providing services that would cost the IRS money to provide if online tax filing were administered directly by the IRS. The IRS stipulates filers must have an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $66,000 or less for tax year 2018, but participating companies have their own requirements and restrictions.While many of the Free File Companies offer free state income tax returns, taxpayers may still pay additional fees of $10 to $30 to electronically file those returns.In 2007, Alliance members agreed to remove controversial ancillary offerings such as refund anticipation loans from the program.In order to receive a free federal tax return the taxpayer must first go to https:/www.irs.gov/freefile.

____


&gt;Not technically impossible. 

####

&gt;We called TurboTax and they gave us a promo code and she didn’t have to pay.

Then she most likely didn't use the IRS *Free File* system, but rather did it through TurboTax (likely starting off with the ""free version"" and then finding out it's not free to file), and they wrote off the loss of revenue by giving her a promo code to avoid the hassle of a pissed off customer who, I'm sure, made it very clear to them that they know that IRS provides the service for free. You/your sister aren't the target here, as you were aware of the IRS Free File. 

The more people who they trick into paying for a service that the customer *knows* the government has mandated they provide for free, the more heat it brings on them. So it was probably much easier for them to just issue a refund or give a promo code to someone who made a big deal about it and indicated that they know it is supposed to be free. 

Anyway, some interesting info/links regarding the IRS Free File:

&gt;Free File provides two options to tax payers: Free File Software (filed through brand-name software, adjusted gross income must be less than $66,000), or Free File Fillable Forms (any income level, filed through online fillable forms).[1][2] Both the Free File Software and Free File Fillable Forms services are managed and operated by the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private tax-preparation companies. **The service is available through the IRS's website at www.irs.gov/freefile. Although the service is accessed via the IRS website, the service is not managed or operated by the IRS.** 


[...]

&gt;**To use IRS Free File, taxpayers must go through the IRS website at www.irs.gov/freefile**. There, taxpayers can find a tax software product one of two ways. They can review a list of companies and their offers. Or, they can use a simple web tool that asks a few questions - such as income, state residency and age - and the tool will locate those software products for which taxpayers are eligible.**Once a taxpayer chooses a product, they will be directed off the IRS.gov site and onto the Alliance member's website to complete their federal tax return.[7]**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_File

Everything here (as well as my own personal experience from last year) indicates that they only way to access the Free File capabilities of one of the companies in the ""alliance,"" that you needed to go through the IRS gateway. [Here's the wiki for the ""Free File Alliance"" \(lol such a corny name\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_File_Alliance) that the tax prep companies formed when they saw that Free File could potentially screw up the very lurcrative racket they had going on. So they essentially formed a (government sanctioned) cartel and they all seemed to understand that the goal was to make it as hard as possible for users to be aware of and/or take advantage of the IRS' Free File system.

Also, so long as we continue to keep cutting the IRS' budget, the chance we'll ever see services like this advertised in a way that it reaches a broad enough audience continues to go down. [That's no coincidence though, as we know that, for every $1 spent on IRS enforcement, we get $6 in revenue.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-08/irs-enforcement-spending-yields-6-for-every-1-lew-says) It's a no-brainer to fund the IRS, and yet... I wonder why we keep cutting their funding...

My point was that, while your sister may have ultimately received the product for free, it was not done through the IRS free file system, rather she was part of a cost/benefit analysis done by TurboTax where they determined that it would likely be more beneficial to them in the long run if they were to just provide a promo code instead of just telling you that you're shit out of luck. Likely because you made it clear to them that you know it should be free through the IRS, and they know what can happen if they do it to the wrong person and end up with a viral story that almost all Americans can relate to and paints TurboTax (and whomever else) in a very bad light.

The outcome (for your sister) is the same, but I think it's still an important distinction because it highlights the shadiness of these companies. They know exactly what they're doing. It's like hush money almost. They know that people are much less likely to make a stink about it (that could potentially go viral and fuck up their profits) if they just give it to them for free. It can also kind of paint them in a positive light in some peoples' minds. As in like, ""man, that TurboTax customer service is just great! They refunded me the cost to file and I said was that the IRS said it should be free!"" When in reality, it's purely a financial decision on their part to take the small loss and avoid the potential fall out.",1578156596,gimlet

Vladimir_Putang,"Those free services are offered by the IRS, and the only reason they were administered through private companies like TurboTax and H&amp;R Block is because they all freaked out that a free option from the IRS would put them out of business.

So the agreement was that these companies would host the IRS's free-file system, allowing people who make (I believe it was) less than $60,000 AGI to file for free through whichever filing service they wanted to so that the private companies would still get the business.

In a totally shocking move, TurboTax (and others) made it basically impossible to actually find a URL for the free-file version, and would often *tell* the customer that they're using a free version and then spring some sort of fees on them at the end. 

The only surefire way I knew to get free-file through the third party tax preparers was by through through the IRS' website which had a free-file gateway and a list of links to the free versions of each third party software/websites.

MarchwasMay,"I liked this mini-season, but I do feel it should have been marketed as a miniseries spin-off thingie:  

**Reply All Presents: Less Tech More PoliSci**: *The Real Enemy*

&amp;nbsp;  
Sort of like *Science Friday* has *Undiscovered*, and *RadioLab* had something that was supreme court focused?  

&amp;nbsp;  

And if it's just 3 episodes or fewer, sure, put it in the same feed, but also have its OWN feed for future developments.

&amp;nbsp;  

**Wondery** does this a lot:  They may preview a show on *American Scandal* (or the interview at the end of an *American History Tellers* mini-season might have the host of New Short Show), and then tell you what to subscribe to for the specific 4-8 episode season of *New Short Show*.  (Examples - the ones on Psycho, JAWS, Star Wars... -- I think they all were called ""Inside [movie name]"")  


And then if you stay subscribed to these mini-seasons, then there are days when ALL of the **Wondery**s have teasers about a new show, but normally only 1 main one will have a sample episode or a partial-ep following a normal ep, so overall, it's not too annoying of a promo style.  

&amp;nbsp;  

(I was surprised in Final Season *StartUp* when they said that they hadn't YET thought of cross-advertising shows within their network!  WTF?  It's the whole point of a network, imho!)

&amp;nbsp;  

So in this case, if *Reply All* first had a normal episode about how tech is doing whatever with grassroots (like many small $ funders instead of a few big people, or the role of GoFundMe &amp; KickStarter in campaigns?), maybe starting out with a YesYesNo that needs similar contextual information to get, and then after 20-30 minutes of that, have 10-15 minutes of *The Real Enemy*.  And again, since it's only 3 episodes, I'd be fine with it in the same feed -- it's only at 4+ that I think a show needs its own feed &amp; title.  

&amp;nbsp;  

I'm even fond of name-changing shows, like the one that was originally about tracking down Richard Simmons, and then about Y2K, and then I think it was something else.  It's not great for name-recognition (as you can see), but like using LastPass, as long as the app knows it's there and the feed works, I'm content.

So if *Reply-All* feels it's more an exploratory show and that it doesn't need a tech hook, let it evolve into ""*All*.""  

&amp;nbsp;

Their relationship was toxic for sure &amp; he's a literal piece of shit. But Taylor is responsable for some of the toxicity as well. She self harmed &amp; threatned suicide if he didn't comfort her. That's her fault, &amp; is emotionally abusive. 

Also on the overdose thing, I don't not believe it, but her story has changed multiple times &amp; she admitted to waiting 5 minutes to narcan him when he overdosed. Again a toxic as fuck relationship. She knew what she was getting into though explicitly.

The flash drive only contains an audio file and no further code. Enjoy!”*

richinsunnyhours,"Oh wow I loved this. I wish this link were on the front page so I could read hundreds of comments reacting to this story! My own thoughts: I’d forgotten Jonathan was married to Emily and immediately felt a sense of betrayal (for literally no good reason) when it was mentioned in the article, as if this were a big secret and the author assumed the name Emily Condon wouldn’t ring a huge bell for the readers. This is fully misplaced, and maybe fueled by the fact that I woke up at 3am and couldn’t sleep and the first thing I did was read this article and the second thing I’m doing is writing this comment. Anyway, very happy for the both of them and after the moment of (misplaced) resentment had passed, I am very grateful for a bit of insight into Jonathan‘s personal life. 


Aside from that, I really loved this article. I did find it ended abruptly, since the author stopped short of describing how they ended up listening to the podcast, what everyone’s reactions were (especially the father’s), and whether anyone in their lives stumbled upon the podcast and spoke to them about it, and if so, what they said. I loved the additional insight into the mother’s first pregnancy and cried all over again (cathartically) reading the details. Also, I was hoping for more explicit detail about Natalie’s reaction to the news of the podcast, and I would have loved to know her reaction. I did enjoy learning how difficult it is to produce the entire episode, especially the ending, and I wonder how long Jonathan and Gimlet Media can sustain this podcast model.

seriouslyokay,"Not who you were replying to, but I've commented on nearly every thread this season and I've found this season the most genuinely affecting one of the four. It's so empathetic, Jonathan's writing just keeps reaching new heights, and more importantly, I think this season did a really good job of focusing on mending, highlighting, or studying relationships. The fact that many of this season's titles are predominantly pairs of people or groups highlights that.

Here's a few of my notes on each episode:

* #24 **Jimmy and Mark** - What an amazing start to the season. It's packed with nostalgia and longing for young freedom. The ending bit made me tear up on my commute home, and gave me that familiar Heavyweight warmth in my chest.
* #25 **Becky and Jo** - An episode about having to rely on your siblings because of your absentee parents that made me, an only child, long for the sibling I never had. Jonathan's depiction of two sisters, holding each other until the sunset, is burned in my mind.
* #26 **Beverley and Van** - Maybe my favorite of the season. The bit where Jonathan says at the end: ""But then, the phone would ring, and Beverly would smile and duck into the other room. And there, reaching out from hundreds of miles away, was her Van. Who was always that way."" I was already in tears, but after that, I just started bawling. Wow.
* #27 **Scott** - The unanimous fan favorite of the season, and for good reason. When the dad said that he felt loved, I felt so warm. When he said that Scott no longer had to be bothered, because he got his boy back, I broke down. Past the sheen and pristine production of Heavyweight is always a story that is deeply human, told with love and honesty.
* 28 **Dr. Muller** - Without a direct subject to talk to, Jonathan's writing shines, and this episode features some of his most elegant prose ever. ""Even though I still don't have what Dr. Muller might call ""a philosophy,"" I eventually came to see that ""what's the use"" was never the right question. The most important things in life have no use. And maybe this is the closest I've come to words to live by.""
* 29 **Elyse** - Unlike the rest of the season, this is darker, less reconciliatory, and more about someone finally getting the closure they needed by cutting someone out of their life. This is just as much about a heavyweight as every other story, but with a brutal honesty that provides us with some perspective.
* 30 **The Marshes** - A great insight into the Heavyweight process. This took ages to do as it's a story that spans weeks and months and years, and yet Jonathan and his producers stayed with it for that long. And even across this time, we never lose our empathy for this wonderful family and the woman they want to connect with. It's so satisfying.
* 31 **Marie-Claude** - But it should really be called **Marie-Claude and Jonathan.** Not only is this episode super funny, cute, and a great story about adult friendship, we also get some insight into Jonathan as a person outside of the podcast. When Marie-Claude says that Jonathan was the only person she could talk to about her father's passing because he's good at talking about death, we know all too well that his deep empathy and understanding of grief continued all the way to adulthood. And really, this episode shows that it's just so nice to have someone root for you, you know?",1576810086,gimlet

The Alabama democratic party is majority black so put forth candidates that represent that.

Hopefully the future of the Alabama democratic party isn't guided by race, but by increasing progressive candidates from areas most effected by the awful policies implemented by the Alabama Republicans.",1576464418,gimlet

Both Reed and Nancy seemed hellbent on demonstrating the stereotype of democrats only framing things in terms of identity politics. Some of that is justified being in Alabama, but they it took it to such an extreme that it seemed that no one in the story could ever criticize them (of some seemingly reasonable things) without them playing it off as it being a gender/race thing respectively. No Nancy, Doug Jones doesn't think you're bad at your job because you're a woman, he thinks you're bad at your job because you haven't opened your mail in five years. 

I'm sure things won't be perfect in the new leadership. Hell, it will be a miracle if Jones can pull off the win against a republican who presumably won't be as damaged as his last opponent. You still get the impression that the party is in much better hands going forward.",1576434310,gimlet

BetaTestMom,"Weighing in as an Alabamian Democrat:

I don't talk politics a lot. I don't even know if my mother is a Republican or a Democrat (or hell, Independent), because in Alabama, it's just safer that way.

If you are at all progressively minded in any very-red state, it can feel very daunting to be interested in even the most fringe-y aspects of politics.  Add to that the sense of spitting into the wind with every vote, and being Democrat in Alabama (and several traditionally red states, I would imagine) can feel fruitless.

Being from what feels like the small-backwoods-town version of a state, I was *giddy* seeing the word ""Alabama"" in the description summary of my absolute favorite podcast this morning.  Then trepidatious when the subject was the Democratic Party of Alabama. Was this an underdog story? Would they talk about spitting into the wind? How many cutesy, folksy, Southern colloquialisms would there be???

After the first episode, I was pissed. I was pissed at my party. Here I was, an average voter, putting my faith in the knowledge that my party was fighting the good fight. That we had *finally* won a small victory with the election of Doug Jones! YAY US!  And then Part One of The Real Enemy showed me that, nope. Nobody was really trying to change anything. No one was digging in their heels, or pushing back against the establishment. What was happening was something I have seen at every family or social gathering with any amount of tension in good ole AL: everyone had taken a stance, picked a side, chosen their friends, and weren't budging. Stubborn. Mule-ish. Not.moving.forward.  One person in a crappy office in the sketchy downtown area of Montgomery I knew so well? I could picture the whole thing. I bet there was even cheap-ass fake wood paneling still on the walls from the 80's.  Ah, Alabama government jobs. I had put my hopes into thinking that here, at least, there was a **war being wages** against the all-powerful Alabamian Republican Party.  WE WILL BE HEARD!

Nope. No, we won't. We want to keep what worked back in the day, and hope to hold on to the status quo.

I live here. The status quo SUCKS.  If I have to hear the fictional virtues of Donald Trump with a placating smile on my face, or come up with anymore non-committal responses to people I've just met in the grocery store, I might scream.  I'm already screaming logical things at you internally. Please, stop talking.

I understand where the sense of ""hang in there, hold on...we have a grip on things, so don't let go"" came from. This was a torturous place to live in the 20th century if you were any kind of a minority, and it's a pretty shitty place for those groups still. BUT, there are genuine allies...genuine progressively-minded people living here who want to do good. And we're being blocked by the people we *thought* we were in the fight with.  It's maddening.  I didn't know it until today, and I learned it...through a podcast...about internet-y things. That makes no sense.

I don't know how I feel about the conclusion of this saga. I don't know if I""m clear on what anyone's motives are.  But I do know this: I am so, so glad Gimlet and Reply All produced this podcast. I've already sent links to my siblings (y'all pray for me at Christmas fucntions).  Now I know...the people that I was imagining were fighting the good fight are not the people who were (and maybe are) in power in the ADP.  I should have known that the ""organization"" was being run just like the church fellowships I went to when I was younger. The older folks are in charge because they've always been in charge, and we don't question it because that's how it is. Well, not anymore.    


The people I was imagining were people like me. And now I am fucking galvanized.  So, thank you, Emmanuel and Sruthi.  You hit at least one set of ears that can maybe make an impact.

decentwriter,"I have to say..Reply All listeners are more ungrateful than listeners of any other show I follow. Making a podcast that’s thematic, interesting and takes you on a crazy journey is HARD and often takes YEARS. The heavyweight episode that came out this week took three years to make. The crazy Reply All episodes that feel the most ~Reply All~ also take months to years to make. Not every single episode can be tracking down scammers on the other side of the world. It’s expensive as hell, and it takes years to research, report and produce in full. Not to mention the legal challenges that come along with shows like that. Every single word in a script is painstakingly reviewed by a lawyer to ensure they don’t say or do anything that misrepresents them or the people they involve in their work. 

I’ll be the first one to say some episodes are better than others, no doubt. It’s like that for literally any show. But every episode is entertaining, and when there’s a period of episodes you don’t necessarily like, it’s probably because they’re working on a really good one but in the meantime have to publish something or else online forums will complain that they don’t upload and gift their fans with content enough. It’s a double edged sword. You can have them upload less, and make more shows you probably will love. Or they can upload regularly and you get to fill your time with shows you may feel meh about while they focus on shows you will love that you’ll hear in a few months. 

Plus, it’s this producers first episode with the show. Cut the dude some slack. Tech is inevitably political, so you’re gonna get politics in a tech show sometimes. It’s not avoidable entirely.

MermaidenMusings,"I so agree that they rely on visual aids. I can’t imagine listening to it as a podcast because most of the goofs rely on video/their expressions. Their little team is very cute and if anything, I wish they were more involved so Ethan would keep his foot out of his mouth more! When their just messing around and shooting the shit it’s quite wholesome but I can’t stand them discussing any series topic that they have no stake in because the research is not there. I had to turn off the Micheal Jackson episode because it seemed they had based their whole opinion on that one documentary. I’ve missed many an episode, like you, if I’m playing Steam I’ll have them on in the background, or if I’m cleaning my room.

I do love the episodes when they have guests I like though! In a way, Ethan’s “unique” interviewing skills does make way for learning new and interesting things about the guests. I do miss the supernatural segment though, that was delightful. 

My favourite thing about this new era is how far Hila has come. I remember when she wouldn’t even be on camera, and now nervous she was and now she twirls about in her podcast chair like a natural. I’m so proud that her art has blossomed into an actual business too. It was the sweetness in their relationship that made me love them and although they’re not the same people I used to watch as comfort, they seem to be going strong and I love that.

Did he really blank on his name when leaving Jean that voicemail? Or did he stammer through ""I'm that guy who came over to your house..."" as sort of a purposeful bit of awkwardness?

Dain42,"She served as editorial advisor on the *This American Life* and *Serial* spin-off podcast *S-Town* (another one regarded as a masterpiece of the medium), and she was a producer/host for *Election Profit Makers*, another short-run podcast.

She's made regular appearances on all kinds of other podcasts on various networks, and earlier this year she started work on a *Mystery Show* spiritual successor — but temporarily set it aside became of an offer to work on or produce another project that she couldn't pass up.

I'm sure there have been other things, too, but it's not like I'm her biographer; I'm just listing things I'm already aware of.

Do people really think she's just been sitting on her hands or twiddling her thumbs for the past three years?

-----------------

As far as Gimlet's rationale or reasons for cutting the show, startups don't work like normal companies — and that means Gimlet doesn't operate like most other podcast networks. Maximum Fun, WNYC, Radiotopia, and many others basically operate to sustainably produce good shows that manage to pay for themselves. Even MaxFun, which isn't a nonprofit like the other two, isn't trying to take in some massive profit. They just want to make good shows and pay the people who make them.

Gimlet, on the other hand, is a startup, and that means they have VCs banging down the door demanding not just sustainability, but exponential growth, and huge profits. Even shows that could be sustainable elsewhere might not fit that business model. Producing a great show that just managed to squeak by isn't enough to get Spotify to buy you out for hundreds of millions.

I'm not saying *Mystery Show* was or wasn't self-sustaining. Kine says it was and that costs people have talked about on here are wildly exaggerated, though. I'm just saying that startups don't always work the way people think makes sense — they operate on a set of very warped priorities — and that means some expectations are out the window. Something can be profitable, but not profitable *enough* for a startup. (This is often true of large, publicly traded companies, too, where investor demand for dividends can produce the same warped incentives.)",1575827025,gimlet

With the podcast format, they have to discuss about EVERYTHING to keep the show running whilst at the same time has 0 expertise on the matter.

Dain42,"&gt; yet Starlee was the one that fixated on shitting on Gimlet for god knows how long

She was a *major* contributor to the early success of the podcast network. Remember that *Mystery Show* made it onto all kinds of ""Best Of"" lists that year, and helped to draw people to Gimlet to check out other shows. It gave Gimlet a certain cachet as new network to have a critically-acclaimed show that was *so* good.

Now, she's not the only person who did that, nor the only show. *Reply All* was also a big early draw, both because they brought listeners from *TL;DR*, and because they do very good work.

But I'd imagine that it still stings, even after a number of years, to play such an important role, and then get (at least according to her) unceremoniously dumped — especially when the *Reply All* folks got equity in the company. (I believe she's also indicated that there was a personal element to it all, feeling ill-treated by someone she trusted from their time working together at *TAL*. But I might be misremembering that part.)

It's also probably pretty hard to just forget about it, when people are *constantly* telling her (even now, after years of being off the air) how much they loved *Mystery Show* and how much it meant to them. If you go to her Twitter and look at her replies, it's still quite frequent. 

Financial stake aside, as a creative person, I'd imagine it's painful to see something you created have that much impact on people but then remain unable to keep doing that thing. Remember that Gimlet still owns the rights to the show, so it's not like she can just go and make *Mystery Show* on her own or at another network.",1575480194,gimlet

L_Silencio,"Look, I loved Mystery Show. Starlee is mad talented. This is undeniable. 

If you want to talk about pedigree, Blumberg has done the same and then more, as far as podcasts go. This American Life, Planet Money, Start-Up, etc...

I’m not gonna deny that the union-busting deal is easily dismissed. I don’t think all the facts are out, but I’m also vehemently pro-union in most contexts. 

However, I think that both Gimlet and Starlee had valid points in what happened, and yet Starlee was the one that fixated on shitting on Gimlet for god knows how long. There’s a certain humor in that.

I don’t think it’s toxic to make a joke about it anymore than your average, mediocre SNL joke/parody/remark is toxic. Calling this humor “toxic” seems excessive.

My goal is to listen to them all—I'm at 154 out of 688 (strictly through the app, that is, many I've heard some or all of over the years). Some of the older political ones are hard to get through. The first few I was like, *OK OK I can see how these lessons are still applicable today, time is a flat circle, history repeats itself.*...but that feeling is hard to sustain. But I'm sure I'll survive. And I've discovered so many great books, other podcasts, etc. from old episodes that the app has basically opened a new portal for recommendations! 

Oh, and for the *really* old ones, like the ones from the '90s, the technical glitches, how giggly and meandering Ira is, even what the show used to be named...I just love it all so much. 

I can remember exactly where I was when I finished episode 5 of Bear Brook. I was so eager to listen to 6 that I actually donated the $20 to be able to do so! Also money well-spent. (And great marketing!) I listen to so many podcasts, and I'm not above the more...tabloid-y true crime ones (to a point) but Bear Brook is in a class of its own.

I didn't even realize TAL had an app. I just bought it! I have so many episodes of that to go through. I was introduced to Heavyweight from that one piece Jonathan did about his job selling newspaper subscriptions. I will definitely take your suggestion and look deep into the Goldstein files on TAL. Also, I'm just gonna go deep on this American Life in general. I've listened to a lot of episodes but I feel like I've barely scratched the surface, and now having the app makes it so much easier!

Honestly, I listen to a lot of informative podcasts and I've been meaning to get into a true crime podcast. After listening to that trailer for Bear Brook, I'm definitely jumping into this one! I've downloaded the first 4 episodes and I'm gonna go on a nice long COLD walk and listen to them.

However, for the full TAL archive, you have to buy the app (best $3 I ever spent) or listen from a Web browser.

SoulSerpent,"Having been in a loosely similar situation as Elyse and somewhat being able to make peace with it, I was really hoping to see some glimmer of transparency and accountability from Billy. 

It was sad to hear that he couldn’t really provide any of it. There were so many things that frustrated and enraged me about how he interacted with Elyse.

* When they first got on the phone, Billy told Elyse he was so happy to hear from Jonathan that she wanted to still be in touch with him. My immediate thought (and I wish she’d have said this, although I don’t blame her because it’s hard being in her position) was “what the fuck dude? She’s been emailing you multiple times over 5 years and you won’t even acknowledge it. Of course she wants to be in contact with you!”

* His blame game bullshit was so telling. He couldn’t help but give his new daughter and dog the same names as his previous family because it’s the local custom? The dude is an Englishman first, an American second, and a Filipino third—not to mention, an ADULT with agency all of his own. He could have just said no if it’s true his new wife suggested those names. Not to mention, since when has he ever felt beholden to follow the local customs, like not stealing cars, not cheating on your wife, and so forth? This dude is just a colossal pussy and his excuse/blame game when Elyse confronted him about it was pathetic.

* I hated this dude’s fast talking and evasion. As both Elyse and Jon pointed out, he loved telling her that he would tell her everything, but he refused to just get to it and divulge any substance at all. He just stalled and stalled and then started blaming his schedule and making other excuses. Then he agreed to put it all in an email, which of course he never sent. He was never going to give Elyse a proper explanation because their isn’t one. Should have just said that instead of evading and bullshitting.

* Probably the most pathetic part of this was how his own self-pity was the only sliver of emotion/humanity he could muster. He was basically in tears begging her to not make him explain himself. “It’s too painful to talk about the past! Let’s just make a future! Please!” Wah, wah, wah. This guy acted like a sociopath his entire life and the only human emotion he can feel is feeling bad for himself. He has zero empathy for the people he fucks over. Worst of all, he promised an explanation and ends up groveling for his estranged daughter to just stop focusing on it and suddenly be on good terms with him again. Billy didn’t want to have this conversation to take ownership of his actions. He just wants that tiny little sliver of guilt inside himself to go away so he can be content that he’s on good terms with Elyse while he continues to ignore and reject her.

* He apparently has done this TWICE before Elyse with his abandoned kids in England? It’s not even a single mistake he’s made. It’s a pattern of behavior. What a fucking scoundrel and slob.

Seriously, fuck this guy. He’s an insincere piece of shit.

Great episode.",1574361022,gimlet
OkapiFan,"I was struck by just how weak Billy is as a person. No courage, no strength. He's not stupid. He knows what he should do.

drleebot,"I think Elyse would disagree there. It sounds like she went from ""I should be trying harder to salvage this relationship"" to ""This relationship cannot be salvaged and it's not my fault,"" which is huge for her.

One note: removing lead paint is not a straightforward matter because the paint is harmless while it's on the wall. It is, in fact, most dangerous while it's being removed (whether on purpose or because it's deteriorating). This is a similar problem to asbestos. The best way to make an asbestos hazard is to try to remove it from a building.

It feels like they wrote a real show with an actual plot that has time for character development and cut 90% of it immediately. The story moves from plot point to plot point and leaves the listener wondering why? 

Why all the sudden talk about 'vishing' from the main character? How does she immediately know what phishing is and why don't they bother explaining it to the audience? Now I can't recommend this show to my parents, great move.

Why does the main character immediately agree to the controlling demands and not feel at all worried about getting involved? She had the option to walk away but didn't, there is no justification for this.

The only reason I can think she would be like this is because she's scamming the scammer, but then I would expect her to *actually be good at scamming* and not throw these massive tells out there.

When there are people there that can trace their a dozen generations, living their 5 months can feel like you're still an outsider. I've lived here going on 4 years and feel like I'm never going to be a ""New Mexican"".

I whole-heartedly disagree with the 3/5 rating of Santa Fe Bite (RIP). It's definitely one of the best Green Chile Cheeseburgers in the state. Unfortunately, they had to close in their original location and it looks like the Reply All crew went to the new location. I'm sorry to see that it's fallen so far.

If you decide to listen on Spotify then it's not exactly difficult to do. Is it less convenient than using whatever other means you're using now? Yes, it is, but only marginally. 

And I disagree your cost is invested time in downloading and listening. Your cost is money, because you can download and listen to anything else you may prefer, or you can do anything else with your time, go for a walk or do some gardening. If you buy a magazine, it's 5 bucks and that's it. Not 5 bucks plus the time it takes you to read it. 

Bottom line: If you accept the fact Gimlet is selling a fraction of your attention spam to the advertisers, then you don't have to pay for their content.

For me, their hunt through Santa Fe; John's reviews; and Alex's interactions with Jessica was all funny and heartwarming and charming. And in this case the ""payoff"" wasn't an actual UFO in the sky, but instead an interesting man with an interesting story trying to find meaning in a life that didn't go according to plan. We can all relate to that, right? 

It's the journey itself. How did we get from a UFO in a photograph on Google Reviews to a conversation with a man known as Cowboy John? Doesn't that interest you??

DrColossusOfRhodes,"For anyone doubting the goodness of Alex's reporting techniques, allow me to tell you some stories from my time in a town about the size of Santa Fe.

I would go out with friends and regularly run into someone I knew wherever we went, and it would turn out the person I was with would know the person we ran into completely independently of me.  This happened too many times to count.  In one case, I started a new class in university and started chatting with the person in the seat next to me.  That night I went home and they were on my couch aging videogames, having spent all summer working with my roommate.  I worked at a juice shop for a while, the only man who did, and people would recognize me randomly all over town as ""the guy who works at the juice shop.""

Another time, I went back home after 6 years of living away, stopped at the mall to grab something first thing.  I ran into no less than 6 people I knew before I made it to the food court.

Once, on Reddit, I told a story about serving coffee to a very famous person at the Starbucks I worked at, probably 12-15 years prior to this comment being made.  In the comments, someone wrote ""was that in (my hometown)? My dad was there too"".  It was, and I have no doubt that I knew this person, or at least one person that they knew too.",1573735394,gimlet

It's true that millimeter wavelengths don't have the energy to cause any dna harm, and yet they also don't penetrate far into our skin (neither does uv light, which does harm our skin). However, that doesn't mean it couldn't theoretically interfere with navigation, if the properties are similar to the signals used for navigation. Because in that case the sensory organs would obviously be placed such that they can pick up these navigation signals that are being interfered with. As far as I know in birds that organ is inside the skull, so it likely uses higher wavelengths, but I don't think it would be a bad idea to have some regulation in place to test if any new such technology interferes with birds, bees etc, since we're not gonna be able to easily get rid of it once it's installed everywhere.

Luke &amp; Obi-Wan had normal homes on Tatooine but had to flee. Leia lived on Alderaan but we start with her on a diplomatic mission (i.e. on a business trip) and then her home is destroyed. Yoda has a home on Dagobah. Lando lives in Cloud City. 

We don't get to see Imperials at home because they're all on active duty. 

I guess the toughest one to figure out is Han &amp; Chewie. For them it might make sense to live on the Falcon or temporarily in ports, that way they can always be working/smuggling without being tied to a physical location. Sort of like George Clooney in Up in the Air where he flies around the country so much giving speeches that he doesn't need a physical home anymore, he just needs luggage and hotel reservations.

I admit, I am compelled to reply to your comment because I do not understand the analogy you are trying to make here. With broadcast TV, you are forced to watch commercials if you watch the show live. If you record the show via DVR, you can fast forward through the commercials. There are many advantages to streaming/cord cutting, but just my initial thought on why I think people do it is a combination of cost savings and convenience. Maybe I am not in front of my tv at 9pm to catch the latest GoT or Walking Dead episode...so what do I do? If I have cable I either DVR it or I miss the episode until it comes on again. If I stream? I have the freedom to watch the episode whenever, however many times I want. If given the freedom to watch a program whenever, plus make it cheaper to do so? Yeah, I'm in.

I understand Heavyweight can't exist without making money. I have no problem if the ads were 10 minutes long (and I couldn't fast forward through them). If that is what it takes to get to listen to these amazing stories, I am all for it. I often listen to those ads without fast forwarding because Johnathan is funny when doing the ads.

She is the on-screen talent, and the voice and face of the brand, but the way she tells the story, she went into this kicking and screaming the whole way. The son is the one who put up the money, coached his mom, and did ALL of the behind-the-scenes stuff to get the videos made and promoted. I also call BS on her 401K losing ""90%"" in the 2008 crash.

Pinchaz0,"This is far from accepted fact. Before EPO, Lance was a one-day rider, and totally useless in grand tours. He was not a good time trialist, and he was hopeless on long climbs. Certainly he lost some body mass during his Cancer treatments, but if you read Tyler Hamilton's book, he finally says what all of us wannabes and has beens have known this whole time: the drugs help you lose weight without getting sick or losing power. So Lance probably can thank the dope for helping him lower his weight for climbing too. But above all, his performance was dramatically increased due to EPO. I would guess he had a naturally low hematocrit, which gave him lots of room to add RBCs and still stay under the limit. He was an amazing rider, and would have won many, many races in a clean sport, but it's unlikely he would have been the greatest TdF rider in history without the drugs.   


Anyway, the reason he got taken down so hard was that he played the good guy for so long, while in the background he kept using his wealth and power (and his even more wealthy and powerful friends) to crush people who went against him. It was shrewd and tactical, just like he was on the bike, but on the bike it's expected. In life you are supposed to follow the Golden Rule ;)",1572283891,gimlet

I think the closest you could get as a publisher if the URL you broadcasted to the podcast feed actually gave every user a different file, determined by some parameters of the request from the podcast client.  Then they'd be serving the ads dynamically, but not really inserting them dynamically.

If Wynn didn’t care about the gun, why did he want it in the first place? Or did he care more about facing Bill’s anger at it being gone? Then when you add in Wynn’s memories of being afraid of his dad... there’s a lot of info that a Nosy Nancy like me would like to dig into there.

Fredifrum,"It's really a matter of terminology.  In traditional RSS podcasts, the file that is original released at the URL is _never_ changed, and lives forever.  Some publishers, though, will routinely go through their back-catalogue and update the files with new ads, so even if you download an old episode, you get served a recent ad.  Is this dynamic insertion?  IMO, it's not, because you're still getting the same file as everyone else, and the file you get is predetermined.  It's very different than something like a YouTube video, where which ad you get served is determined the instant you click the video, and is specific to you.

Some podcasts might have slightly smarter algorithms, like serving different files to different regions, swapping out the ads weekly, or randomizing the file that gets served even.  Still, I wouldn't call this ""dynamic insertion"", because the ads aren't being inserted in real time into the podcasts.  Even if you're streaming them from your podcast player, you're still streaming a file served at a URL.

The physical gun is meaningless to Scott's dad.
He doesn't even care to hold it once he buys it back.

All that it represented was Scott's journey to undo the pain he has caused. It was all for Scott.

His dad is basically saying ""Ok its over now. Stop chasing these items and know that I love you and appreciate that you're alive""

He went and bought the gun back to put Scott's life back at ease. He knew how important the gun was to his son for the recovery of his actions.

By the end of the story, the gun itself has no physical value to them. 

So yes, the gun should/could go to the uncle. He was never able to see what the gun meant to his brother and nephew (not that he should have to either).

 Jonathan and his team have the truly incredible ability of flipping their listeners' expectations and presenting the same story with a perspective that feels far more meaningful and beautiful than the one you (and sometimes the story's subjects) have held. It's almost like solving a Rubik's cube. It's a serious gift that they have - I don't think I've ever seen it done so well or so consistently elsewhere in any form of media. 

Heavyweight makes me think about all the hidden threads running through our own lives, and if there are ways of sliding these perspectives and narrative threads in place to reach a form of true clarity and healing.",1571965888,gimlet

If they can keep people engaged and subscribed, but listening to content that Spotify owns and doesn't have to pay royalties on, it helps them convert more of that subscription money into profit.

skleroos,"I loved this mini season. I started my PhD in autumn of 2014 when gimlet was starting, and finished it last year, so this start-up coincides with a special time in my life and holds a special place in my heart. Hearing about all the struggle they've been going through made me glad I've been supporting them all this while and giving people reality checks about their expectations for free media. Alex and Matt sound like a couple who is afraid that if they say one hurtful thing they're going to break up, so they're always being careful around each other and choosing their words, becoming exhausted. I guess also because whenever they talk to each other it's because there's some problem that needs solving, so they barely experience positive things together. I wonder if getting rich together solved that : D. I also wish we'd have heard more from the employees, Startup is over, Conglomerate has begun. 

It's true that the market is over saturated. I listen to everything at 2x speed, and I just can't get through everything or even most of what I want to listen to, especially as I sometimes want to listen to music as well. Already a couple of years ago I separated my stuff to tiers 1 to 3, and I've yet to be able to listen to anything not in tier 1. But I guess my taste is expensive, because I barely have any chat shows at the top of my playlist, except judge John hodgman and a podcast about Russian history. 

I wish Spotify would actually do something to become better for podcasts. All I need is separate speed controls for each show, automatic downloads where I can choose how many at a time and whether oldest or newest first, a playlist with a priority order, a good recommendation service, a good search function and ability to listen to just one episode instead of subscribing. Yet I've yet to find an app that has all of that. Although the one I'm using has almost all and is quite alright.",1571819155,gimlet

The shows are often more ""turns out"" or ""let's press these different story lines into a comprehensive narrative""-type programs. People always refer to the India episode of ""Reply All"", and it was definitely fun to listen to, but was it a good journalistic piece, really, I even remember some conclusions drawn which seemed kind of off. I really don't get the point of ""Without Fail"" for example. Yet another podcast were successful and (often times) really really rich people talk about how the struggle got them where they are today, I know like 35 podcasts like that?

I'm not trying to shit on this stuff. I am here because I like much of what Gimlet does and offers, and I was a fan of Alex at TIL and PM already, so this is coming from a place of a fan. I was just getting a little mad at his comments. I really felt like he was dismissing a large chunk, and kind of the origins of podcasts. It also felt to me like he wasn't really thinking about it.

I agree with most of your post. But the point of Spotify acquiring Gimlet wasn't to make money immediately. It was to make Spotify a serious player in the podcasting world. And if it does ""increase their overall value"" then they *will* make money in the acquisition.",1571758286,gimlet

DLDude,"What really bothers me about this whole series is that not only gimlet, but nearly all the companies they profiled barely ever made money! Early in this season they say gimlet was blowing through $10m/yr. They go on to ""successfully"" turn a profit magically right before the sell, though that profit number is not quantified nor any information on what it took to get.

Its frustrating to me to hear people call gimlet a successful business. Yes, if made  100 investors money, but the company itself, in 4yrs, had 1 profitable quarter (meaning they probably are still about $20m in the hole)

Spotify won't make money the in acquisition, but will increase their overall value so they can sell to someone down the line too.

And Gimlet ends up looking like they just got really lucky, flailing around not doing obvious things to grow their company, and were looking for any kind of ripcord to save their hemorrhaging bank accounts.

baldnotes,"&gt; The snobby comment about not wanting to produce a Keeping Up With the Kardashian's recap podcast was so telling. I'm sure many Gimlet listeners would enjoy high quality shows centered on popular culture: look at the ""Yes Yes No"" segment on Reply All -- it is precisely the ""3 guys around a mic"" model that Gimlet eschews, covering current events and topical cultural topics that they also eschew. I think there was a deep failure of imagination around producing podcasts in this vein that could have resulted in a lot of successful programming for Gimlet.

It was precisely this in the first episode of this seasons, where he said, that nowadays many podcasts are cheaply made, with a person talking, charismatic figures, etc. And it seemed so weird to me, as if he had no clue about the podcast culture at all. Those podcasts existed and were popular long before Gimlet. He was just so in his NPR-bubble that he dismissed them. The idea that these podcasts can't have quality because they're made with less money is ridiculous. I like Alex, and I think it's a problem if you're someone like Matt, who is just a ""numbers guy"".

It bothered me that he was so in his ""This American Life""-style podcasts or no podcasts at all mindset. Every big publisher has to sell their Stephen Kings, so they can sell their Vollmans.

IolantheRosa,"I have so many thoughts on the StartUp journey, based of course only on what we were allowed to see from the outside. I think they tried to make a case that the push-me-pull-you of the Matt/Alex dynamic was ultimately productive for the company: since Alex was not interested in Gimlet as a business, merely as a platform for a somewhat narrow idea of what constitutes quality programming,  Matt was indispensable in holding up the business end, and the sum of two approaches was greater than its parts. But if the goal was profitability, then that model failed, because they had to sell the company in the end, despite their protestations that the ship was being turned around by some late-stage adjustments to their sales strategy.

I'm sure many Gimlet listeners would enjoy high quality shows centered on popular culture: look at the ""Yes Yes No"" segment  on Reply All -- it is precisely the  ""3 guys around a mic"" model that Gimlet eschews, covering current events and topical cultural topics that they also eschew.

When fantasizing about what they would do with $1B, there was another telling moment: the (admittedly kind of joking?) fantasy of hiring Jad Abumrad with those $. Without a doubt, Jad is a god of quality public radio-style podcast production.  However, I'm sure I'm not alone in finding that model of podcasting to be somewhat tiresome and dated -- how many of us listen to RadioLab and FreshAir on 2x speed?

SoulSerpent,"I didn’t mean they should all end the same way necessarily. I just like seeing the subject have the chance to confront their past, and that can turn out many different ways, which is what I find to be the interesting part. For example, in the opening episode of this season (about the bike trip), each of the guys who were on that trip had different memories and reactions when contacted for the podcast. For some of them, it was a huge moment in their life that they remember vividly. For others, they had forgotten details or didn’t think much of it. In the babysitter episode, the former babysitter was excited to be back in touch but also didn’t remember many of the tiny details that stuck with the kids. In the sorority episode from a couple seasons back, most of the sorority sisters refused to even talk to Jonathan. The episode where Jonathan reconnected with his old girlfriend involved lots of happy reminiscing and then later a tearful apology via voicemail.

All of these characters responded differently I love looking forward to seeing how people react when the subject of the podcast dredges up the past. I didn’t hate this episode.

Fredifrum,"Great episode.  I did find it interesting that when they were explaining why Spotify wanted to get into Podcasts, they ignored what I thought was one of the primary reasons: no royalty fees.

Spotify's music business is costly.  Each time a user plays a song on their platform, they need to pay out fees to the owners of that music.  As such, it's been very difficult for Spotify to turn a profit for its entire run.

Enter podcasts.  Podcasts have no associated royalty fees, and can occupy the ears of their listeners instead of music.  Each time a user opens Spotify and decides to listening to a podcast _instead of_ music, Spotify saves money.  That's why they've redesigned the entire app to put music and podcasts together.  They're opening you'll open the podcast, at no cost to them, instead of the music.

From my understanding, this was one of the primary drivers of the acquisition.  I'm not too surprised it wasn't brought up in the podcast, since its pretty financial and calculating, but I was hoping for some mention.

3unknown3,"I enjoy having discussions like this, but I usually avoid doing this on the internet for obvious reasons.  So I was pleasantly surprised that this happened.

I don’t know how it is in Canada, but the US is pretty divided on a lot of issues.  What’s troubling to me is that both sides have dehumanized the other.  I have fairly deep convictions about the right to bear arms, but it’s not the fact that people have views different from mine that troubles me.  What’s actually troubling is the division and dehumanization of “the other.”  You can recognize the legitimacy of someone’s views without necessarily agreeing with them.  Both gun owners and non gun owners alike are normal people with legitimate concerns and views.  I would rather educate a gun control advocate and allow them to educate me than screech at them, even if it makes their arguments stronger.  At least then we can have a substantive discussion about the merits and trade offs of various policies and come to a more thoughtful and nuanced solution.

I’m an engineer by education and trade and I’m just by nature a contrarian.  My answer to everything is always “it depends” and will refute my own answers so that I can give you all the options.  The more you know and think about something, the more you realize how much you don’t know and that almost all positions are just different sets of trade offs.  Unfortunately, this doesn’t make for exciting news, so instead we just have people throwing slogans and canned talking points at each other.

It’s really odd to me when people have political views on technical topics.  I heard a Republican congressman on the radio the other day and his position on climate change was that the cause of it should be balanced between man made and natural, as if reality should somehow conform to his political views rather than the other way around.",1570980343,gimlet
3unknown3,"That’s wasn’t my intention and I don’t actually disagree with most of what you said.  I think you do raise an interesting point with “no true Scotsman.”

All hunters are by no means saints.  It’s evident just from this episode that there are a troubling number of hunters who contribute to the feral hog problem and have a wildly different definition of fair chase as compared to traditional hunters.  What was eye opening to me was that even just paying to hunt feral hogs without any unethical gimmicks is also just contributing to the problem.  Feral hog hunting as a hunting activity is clearly broken and is pretty unregulated compared to other types of hunting.

But I also think it’s unfair to judge all hunters on the actions of feral hog hunters.  I want to point out that the situation is completely different for other types of game.  Those conservation efforts are funded in large part by hunters through licenses and stamps.  Even the really expensive trophy game hunts of endangered species can actually be a net good for conservation of said species despite how distasteful it may seem.  So in these cases, when it was a question of the environment vs hunting fun/money, the environment actually did win out and now we have a robust regulatory and conservation system funded by hunters.  It’s a classic win-win.

True, most hunters probably aren’t hunting because they want to conserve animals, but we’ve managed to create a system that is good for both hunting and conservation for other game.  The trick is finding a system that works for feral hogs.  This is a unique problem because over-hunting actually causes the opposite of extinction, which the current regulatory and cultural climate is ill equipped to handle.  We’ve made the mistake of assuming that lax regulations on hog hunting will help eradicate the species.  This is a pretty reasonable assumption, but one that has been proven wrong.  Unintuitive laws are always going to be an uphill battle to pass, but I’m hopeful that we can regulate hog hunting as strictly as we do waterfowl hunting.",1570977727,gimlet

People always say this, and always get contradicted when the going gets tough and a real conflict between the environment and hunting fun/money arises. Like, wild hogs being introduced everywhere for the purposes of hunting, and growing out of control. Hunters are only kept vaguely in check and pointed in the right direction by government force. Unless this is a ""no true Scotsman"" thing? 

It's worth noting that there can be environmental benefits to hunting, and that some hunters try to be responsible sometimes, yes. Let's not start claiming that they're the *real* heroes, instead of conservationists and scientists and anti-poaching law enforcement/security, etc.",1570900955,gimlet

Spotify doesn’t own the music its subscribers consume and has to pay a royalty to the studios for every stream. It has no fixed cost leverage. In fact, the more its users listen, the higher its costs. Contrary to folks who like to say that Spotify is the ‘Netflix of music’, its business model (prior to the Gimlet acquisition) was the opposite of the Netflix model.

By acquiring Gimlet and starting to own its content, and assuming it is able to pick up new users willing to subscribe at least partly on account of that proprietary podcast content, Spotify will be able to start deriving its fixed cost leverage and start making money like a true SaaS company.",1570872930,gimlet

Yes, of course, Jonathan did not go full-on interrogation mode, but my answer to the poster before me is correct in that he did try and get to the bottom of what happened. When asked whether she got a call from the babysitter, the mom says:

""As I remember it, I just got a call from somebody at school that no one came to pick up your kids. And that felt like the worse thing I had ever done in letting my kids down.""

thus implying (she doesn't remember) the baby sitter calling, otherwise she would have acted.

In other words, she's saying the only call that she got was from the school. Not from Letiche. 

But maybe, you're trying to say that the point of the podcast wasn't to lay blame on either the mom or the babysitter? yea, okay. but that's not exactly what I meant by ""you are left to choose who to believe"".

She also comes across as a bit delusional. She took the fact that she has a chance to pitch for 100k as validation that investors are wrong for not giving her 5m. I agree with Michael (which I don't a lot of the time) her math was just completely off. Michael was actually the perfect investor for this sort of pitch, everyone else was too polite.

It's normally a huge area. Like, several kilometers per side. Both starting and maintaining that fence is very expense. 

Then, as you said, the hogs just sort of dig under it or push through it. I've seen non-electric fences where they just bowl over a couple of the posts, and others where they dig under an electric fence. Filling the holes again is a task like Sisyphus pushing the boulder up a mountain. It takes them very little time to dig under the fence again, and they can pretty much dig anywhere along the fence-line, so it requires daily attention and maintenance. 

Ultimately, fences are just not an effective deterrent.",1570808612,gimlet

Mr. Spotify is right, this an iconic quote and seems a perfect conclusion for Gimlet Media journey as a Start-Up

Some other thoughts on the episode:

\- I feel like I'm one of the reasons podcast grew on Spotify because I became addicted to it when I discovered Spotify has it and I wanted to maximize my premium subscription \^\_\^

\- I wished they recorded the Matt and Alex shouting match! Of course I know that time podcast use is the least thing in their mind but hey  wouldn't it be glorious to hear that. 

\- I though the bed talk between Matt and Nazanine because didn't I hear this before that Alex couldn't sleep and Nazanin tries to kill time browsing Royal Family pictures? Oh then I get it a callback lol

\- Glad to hear that The Cut is successful for the, it's a good show! 

\- I could relate to that Gimlet staff who was kinda grateful her work lessen with slow sales but her financial mind stopped her from being totally happy!

\- Matt talking about Thanksgiving dinner during Spotify sales had me laughing hard, I could imagine the face of the lady she was talking about him rambling on gravy like hey this is a big deal that could change your life and you're worried about gravy? 

\- The question""What would you do if i give 1 billion dollars"" and the follow up explanation that Mr. Spotify wants Alex and Matt to think that scale because that's how they play at gave me chills. I could just imagine what they were feeling when they were asked that

\-It was fun that Alex asked him if there was a chance they could have failed with that question and Mr. Spotify said that yes and the way he explained what the ideal and not ideal answer was insightful. He has an insightful perspective

\- I could feel Alex gush when he praised Gimlet as the HBO of Podcast!

\- LAST EPISODE next week? WHY?!!! I want to know so much more and I'm not ready to let Start Up go :(",1570798278,gimlet

I also grew up in suburban and urban environments.  Walking through busy cities actually makes me happy and I think I’m a city person at heart, but since moving to Texas, I’ve also come to discover my inner redneck that I didn’t know existed.

I live in Texas, where there’s very little public land to hunt on.  You either need to know someone who’s willing to take you along or pay a lot of money.  I wish I could just go out into the woods every weekend during hunting season, but that proposition is harder if you have to pay each time or get an expensive deer lease.  Hog hunting is relatively cheap, but after listening to this episode, I’m not sure that I want to support that industry.

It's how a pair of friends treat these kinds of things. When me and my friends do the same thing over and over again to bug each other, that same thing happens - eventually, they just begin to find it hilarious and turn it back on you, like Jackie is doing.

lauraam,"&gt; He once mentioned that the pact he has made is that, one day, he will kill and skin an animal he eats, and if he is able to do it - he will earn eating meat. If not, he'll become a vegetarian. I decided to enter into that pact myself sometime.

This is why I'm a pescatarian—I feel that I could kill a fish if someone put a live one in front of me and I had to kill it to be able to eat fish, but I couldn't do the same to a cow or some other kind of animal. I'm not in favour of killing animals as a whole, but I've got a lot more time for hunters who are connected to where their meat is coming from and are often killing those animals more ethically than those killed in factory farming, than people who try to pretend like because they buy their chicken skinned and boned and wrapped in plastic that it's not really coming from a once-living thing.

marcuccione,"Hi, I’m a hunter. A novice, but a hunter nonetheless. In the three years I’ve been hunting, I have yet to kill anything. 

Getting into hunting is really hard since there aren’t many that are willing to mentor the next generation. I’ve had to wade through forums and trial and error because no one is willing to show me how locally. They are all afraid of giving up their favorite spots. 

I like the idea that I know where my food comes from and that I did my level best to ethically kill my meal. I also want it to be there when I need it again. In this case conservation is important. 

Most of all, I like taking myself out for a walk away from the general population and to see what nature has provided. Today I think I learned what grouse sound like, I found some quail, I found rabbit poop and horse poop (we have a feral horse problem), and two dead horse skeletons that probably starved to death (sad). 

As an adult, it is hard. But it’s worth getting away from it for a while to go find some small game.

ZeGoldMedal,"Yea - that's why I'm not against hunting as a total concept, I understand it's mostly not that stereotypical image you sometimes get of yeehawing rednecks blowing up hogs - and that it is actually good for population control and for environmental reasons a lot of the time. I have a lot of respect for hunters who do it for that, which seems to be most from my experience. I was raised in a suburban environment in Virginia, still not rural at all, but close enough that I definitely knew kids at school who hunted - and most seemed pretty cool and respectful of the whole thing.

Also, don't know if you listen to Judge John Hodgman, but there was an episode of his podcast I listened to years ago that still sticks with me. I don't want to be a vegetarian, I'm not - but I also think it might be better for the planet then eating meat for the most part, and I also feel some guilt eating a living being. He once mentioned that the pact he has made is that, one day, he will kill and skin an animal he eats, and if he is able to do it - he will earn eating meat. If not, he'll become a vegetarian. I decided to enter into that pact myself sometime. Hunters have earned their meat-eaterhood more than most of us - and not to mention, meat you've hunted yourself is 1000% more environmentally friendly than anything you'll find in the grocery store.",1570722735,gimlet

DrColossusOfRhodes,"For what it's worth, I'm Canadian, so I'm not familiar with the ins and outs of American gun laws.  

I was taught gun safety from a young age, as were my younger sisters, yet I still do think it was irresponsible of my parents to leave the gun out as they did.  Sure, we never had any problems, but the trouble with that argument is that the ones who don't aren't around to speak up about it.  

I don't currently own any guns, but if I did they would be locked up.  I would teach my kids gun safety and let them shoot, but only when I was there to do it with them, and not before they were 10 or so.  While I'm not an expert in guns, I do study brain development in kids professionally.  They can learn rules well, but the part of your brain that helps you evaluate whether something is a good idea or not, and to stop if it's not, is the hardest part for kids to use and is the slowest to develop (it doesn't reach maturity until around 25).  I'm all about giving them practice in using those skills in restraint and good judgement, but I leave it to lower stakes decisions.",1570722386,gimlet

From my limited exposure to hunting culture and having taken hunter safety and talking to hunters, hunters really care about their image and look down upon the type of hunter who only does it because he likes to kill things.

Still my favorite twitter meme, but now I have awareness. These feral hogs feel like a larger metaphor for all of our problems - seemingly impossible to solve, and often solving them just makes the problem worse. Important to know about. On the plus side, they're probably making the boar gods in Princess Mononoke proud.

Also - I'm not anti-hunting. It's not something I'm interested in, but I understand it. But I'm not going to pretend the people who took an unabashed pleasure in killing/blowing up the hogs, especially in this nakedly capitalist way where they were they taking so much joy that instead of solving the problem they were making it worse by increasing the population - that whole little bit made my blood curdle. Obviously, invasive species are a problem and the only solution is killing them off....but these pigs have proven to be intelligent and taking delight and cheering at killing anything intelligent makes me feel icky - especially when it only exacerbates the problem you're trying to solve.

3unknown3,"I may not be remembering it correctly either, but I believe he said ""assault rifles"", which if you want to be technical about it, means a rifle of intermediate caliber (such as .223/5.56, which is the most common chambering for an AR-15) with a detachable magazine capable of firing in both semi-auto and full auto.  So, a civilian AR-15 would not meet this definition because they don't have full auto capability.  Not to put words in someone else's mouth, but I think you can safely say that the spirit of his tweet was that a semi-auto AR-15 is unnecessary for civilians to own as it would be bizarre to be so strongly against full-auto AR-15s, which are pretty much never used in mass shootings.  I would agree that if I were shooting at multiple moving targets in a yard also containing my family members, I would ideally use a semi-auto, or a bolt action as the next choice, over a fully automatic weapon.  You just can't shoot precisely with a full-auto in that type of situation.

Your second point is actually a really interesting subject.  Everyone has to make their own risk calculations and there's a tradeoff to every decision.  Your parents kept a loaded rifle accessible for immediate use, yet it seems you and your sister turned out okay and didn't have any accidents.  Do you feel that was irresponsible of your parents?  Or did they properly weigh the risks and take measures to mitigate the risks of leaving a loaded rifle within easy reach?  At the same time, the man in the podcast who used his hunting rifle to defend his family against feral hogs seemed to not have his hunting rifle available for immediate use.  It seemed that he had to go get his rifle, find ammo, and load it up before it was ready.  Despite all that, he was able to successfully defend his family.

I don't think that proper storage and gun safety are mutually exclusive with being able to use it immediately.  Child gun safety, in particular, is something I think is similar to responsible alcohol use and sex education.  I think we can approach gun safety from the same angle.  If you teach your children how to properly and safely use a firearm and teach them proper respect for it, you take the mystery out of it.  Whereas if you hide and lock up your guns, they're going to be more curious.  And if and when they eventually find them, they will be completely unprepared to handle them safely.  Is leaving a loaded gun accessible to anyone in the household risky?  Yes, but you can mitigate that with proper education and you also gain the advantage of being able to use it in more situations.  Not saying that's the right calculation for everyone, but it's a viable one for a lot of families.

I'm very much a gun enthusiast, but I didn't grow up with them and entered the gun culture rather late in life.  I sometimes think that teaching high school students the basics of rifle marksmanship and safety, just as we do sex ed and responsible alcohol use, would go a long way towards fighting irresponsible gun ownership.  Like it or not, a large number of families (something like 40% of households) own guns and it's a fact of life for living in America.  I think it makes sense that we teach our children to utilize this right responsibly.",1570720353,gimlet

I've got no problem with bolt-action rifles, and generally speaking, if the use of the gun is for hunting/pest control, I don't really think it makes a huge difference what the firing mechanism is (unless in a situation in which particular care is required, ie, firing into the yard at fast moving animals where your kids are).

3unknown3,"I don't think the underlying premise was that he should be firing a (fully) automatic rifle into the yard.  The gun at the center of the debate is the AR-15, which he references and is actually semi-auto. A lot of people don't realize that the AR-15s used and owned by the vast vast majority of gun owners and used, unfortunately, by mass shooters are semi-auto.  Not saying that makes them significantly less deadly, but it's a common misconception.  Since the guy admits to never having fired an AR or AK and seems unfamiliar with those types of rifles, his hunting rifle is most probably a bolt action.  As in, it has a magazine holding multiple rounds, but you need to cycle the bolt by hand after each shot, which you're probably familiar with.

It also doesn't help that ""automatic"" is actually a fairly vague term that can be used to refer to both semi-auto or full auto.  A lot of militant gun owners will scream about how their AR-15s aren't ""automatic"" because they think automatic only means full auto and the other side just thinks all guns that are ""automatic"" are fully automatic.  My semi-auto Colt 1911 handgun says ""Automatic Caliber .45"" on it, my semi-auto AR-15 says ""Semi"" on the fire selector switch, and a military AR-15 (M4 or M16) would have another position on the fire selector switch labeled ""Auto"", so it's clear just from this example that automatic can mean either full or semi depending on the context.  It really helps to always qualify automatic with semi or full.

I think it's interesting to point out that, at least in my reading of your post, you think a semi-automatic rifle is a reasonable defense for this type of rural problem.  Knowing that the AR-15s and AKs that are widely accessible to civilians are semi-auto, would you consider an AR-15 or AK to be a reasonable defense against feral hogs?  Seeing as the guy most probably used a bolt-action rifle, clearly an AR-15 wasn't necessary.  But at the same time, I would personally rather have the AR-15 for this type of problem simply for the ability to be able to have quicker follow up shots, which would provide a significant edge versus a large number of moving targets.",1570716463,gimlet

DrColossusOfRhodes,"I grew up in a farm, and while I am very liberal in most ways, I have no trouble with people who want to hunt or farmers who need to do pest control.  My parents kept a loaded rifle by our front door because we had animals that would pick off our turkeys, who were at the time much larger and more fearsome that my little sister.  So when I heard the initial tweet, I laughed at the weird specificity of it, but I understood the general problem. 

The thing that really bugged me about it was the underlying premise that he should be firing an automatic rifle into a yard where his kids are.  This is what is insane about that tweet.  Especially  since this actually did happen to him and he handled it with a rifle that was presumably semi-automatic or less (the difference is that semi auto fires every time you pull the trigger whereas an automatic rifle just fires as long as there are bullets and the trigger is pulled).  Then he handled it by firing into the air.  He probably could have done it just by banging pots and pans together (my aunt, who is just a touch over 5 feet, chases actual damn bears out of her yard this way). 

Also, warfarin does work on people.  Its what they give you if you have blood clotting issues, just in way lower doses than are poisonous.

WinterOfFire,"They started out with great ads.  The reason they play music behind their ads started because the ads were almost indistinguishable from content at first.  

It was the first time I listened to ads since the 15-30second skip feature was introduced.

They’d have like 10 or more unique ads for a season of a podcast per company where they wouldn’t just promote the product but they’d tell you something interesting about the company, employees, users etc.  I remember the mi undies ad where they talked for a bit with an employee whose office/cubicle was filled with stacks of boxes of underwear.

I believe they found it too expensive and advertisers weren’t willing to pay for it.  As their podcast library grew, this also made the quantity of ads bigger.

If you go back to an early Startup episode where they messed up with these ads you’ll see another girder they hit.  They accidentally misled a parent about why their kid was being interviewed about his Minecraft website. They thought it was for an episode of This American Life/NPR or something and then it showed up in an ad on a podcast made by a for-profit company.  This was a big scandal at the time.  So they tried a quicker/cheap way to generate a bunch of unique ads and almost got sued.

I hear you.  The ads suck.  I actually thought at the beginning that this company was going to revolutionize ads and make them interesting enough that people will actually listen and advertisers will pay more and everyone wins.  Plus they made it ethical by playing the music so it wasn’t like a sneaky product placement thing.

Maybe no matter how interesting the ad, I’m either going to buy mi undies or not so it made no difference to the revenue for the advertisers.  Or maybe they never had a chance to test it out because advertisers weren’t willing to pay more and as a start up, controlling costs is key.

Fredifrum,"That was also very interesting to me, but makes perfect sense.  I started listening to Podcasts right around when Gimlet was starting up, around 4-5 years ago. At that time, I listened exclusively to highly produced shows like Startup, Reply All, This American Life, Radiolab, and Freakonomic Radio.

But, over the lifespan of the company, my listening habits have changed exactly in the way Alex described and feared.  Nearly all my listening time these days goes to conversational shows in news, politics, and tech (things like Pod Save America, the Vergecast, Accidental Tech Podcast).  All highly unscripted, regularly releasing, easy to listen to, and cheap to produce.  I listen to the aforementioned shows way less often than I did previously, simply because there's so much other great content to keep up with.  My listening habit evolution is Gimlet's worse nightmare!

It makes the acquisition make perfect sense.  In order to produce content aligning with Gimlet's vision, they couldn't survive in a market that was growing more and more crowded by cheap-to-produce shows.  It was like trying to release a triple-A game on the Android app store.  They needed a big backer if they wanted to keep releasing shows they want to release.",1570467309,gimlet

For real? This was a really heartbreaking episode but as always Jonathan found a really beautifully happy and touching way to end it.

These two girls were given very little attention and love as kids. Like, painfully little attention. That diary entry was rough, but the fact that they had 16 nannies and that the dad supposedly didn’t even want kids? That stuff will make a huge impact on kids, even if it’s all subtle.

Yet they had each other, and they formed this incredibly beautiful and intense bond just loving and taking care of one another.

I thought it was awesome. I’m very close to my brother, and while our upbringing was with loving parents we had to grow up as immigrants to a new country and that made friendships more challenging.

Also love that we finally found why Nazanin had a new job. I remember someone commented here, that her job change was so random and we  didn't know about it. Definitely felt just listening to their interview the clashes between Alex and Matt. Creative vs Commercial, the never-ending battle in mass media.

Glad it ended on a funny note with Matt was expecting Spotify people to approach him after the meeting but nothing, I imagined him there, awkwardly waiting for some move from them.

For me this is probably the one episode of this whole show that has hit home the most. Me and my siblings had basically the exact same childhood experience. Our parents were very absent, especially my mother as she was overseas a lot for work. I'm not sure how it affected my brother, but I have this image seared into my head of my sister, age about four, screaming and holding onto the legs of our poor 19 year old nanny (who my sister basically thought was her mom) trying to leave the house. In turn, as the older sister I would think these women were my friend, and then when they left, the whole ""they don't even want to be my friend even if they get paid for it"" was super internalised, like Jo.

Every time we got a new nanny (we also had about 16!) , my little sister would grow extremely attached and I'd watch her be devastated when they would leave about two - six months later. I think it really affected our attachment styles as adults - she has abandonment issues, and is a real people pleaser, where as I am very closed off (and a little distrustful) of people. The whole family dynamic of the people in this episode really hit home to me.

And then I felt there wasn't much closer about what *actually* happened, but I get they probably don't want to claim too many bad things about their mother on a podcast.

If you saw it more as pressuring them into unnecessary services fair enough. We can't really know which one it is without a follow up after the company has actually built out those services.

I guess the broader question is should a company that has information about a parent and their child be able to keep that data in order to provide them with a related service later. Is it ok if it makes your life more convenient. I think if it's opt in and people want recommendations based on their child's development they should be able to get it and it's not that bad a thing.

(I didn’t even realize they were *only* posting Without Fail until just now. Kind of lame!)

This show was always at its best when it was about Gimlet, and frankly it never should have covered anything else—though some of the seasons (Dov Charney, Eva Moskowitz, Dating Ring) would’ve been good standalone miniseries.

But I subscribed again just now, and I’ll listen through to the end.

I’ll be honest: before Gimlet was acquired I listened to all their shows. I wanted to support them because they were an independent company finding their footing and Ghent seemed to be trying to gems make good stuff. After they were acquired I did a long hard think, and dumped most of them other than Reply All. What was originally supposed to be a network of groundbreaking, artistically free shows had essentially become a factory that churned out low-effort clickbait and reality programming. And their attempts at fiction have been embarrassingly bad, except for about half of the first season of Homecoming. Even their prestige shows like Heavyweight (one of the others I still listen to) have gone far downhill; did anyone listen to that godawful multi-week Miller High Life ad? And now they’re partnering with the Wall Street Journal, a right-wing publication owned by Rupert Murdoch.

Unyx,"They missed the best part of the Brett Stephens thing!

When they quote the article about the Polish antisemite saying 'the bedbugs are on fire,' in the original version of the article published there was a hyperlink that led to a source. The source is a book that goes out of its way to say that there's a good possibility that they were talking about literal bedbugs and not using the term as an antisemitic slur. There was an actual infestation of bedbugs at the time in Warsaw.

But here's the kicker: if you followed the link in the article, it shows you what Brett Stephens searched. You could see that Stephens searched 'Jews as bedbugs' and went with the only source that came up  even though that source didn't do much to bolster his claim.

To add some context that might explain their out-of-place usage of the phrase, it's not a buffet that I'd consider to an be ""authentic"" Japanese restaurant.

WikiTextBot,"**Sleep paralysis**

Sleep paralysis is when, during waking up or falling asleep, a person is aware but unable to move or speak. During an episode, one may hallucinate (hear, feel, or see things that are not there), which often results in fear. Episodes generally last less than a couple of minutes. It may occur as a single episode or be recurrent.The condition may occur in those who are otherwise healthy or those with narcolepsy, or it may run in families as a result of specific genetic changes.

Or the confession about wanting to checkout of the rehab after the mandatory period and not planning to actually quit doing drugs.

cpotter361,"There’s also a subreddit that amazon sellers visit which is r/fulfillmentbyamazon. Youll see a ton of cautionary tales in there. 

Ive been selling on Amazon since 2008, and I can tell you it is more difficult than ever to make money on Amazon - especially it you dont know what you are doing. 

To succeed you need two main things: Working capital and a unique edge.  If you are creating your own brand, your unique edge either needs to be superior marketing skills or something new to the market (think something you can patent, etc). If you are reselling other peoples products, you need to be able to make really good relationships with brands to get deals or exclusives others cant get. 

If you dont have those unique edges, you face a blood bath of competition, inclusing amazon themselves and chinese sellers that dont play by the same rules.   Those sellers do all sorts of shady things to sabotage others, and to sell their own products. 

This all doesnt even deal with the fact that Amazon themselves dont treat 3rd party sellers well.  Theres a saying we have in the business of “if you havent been screwed over by amazon, you havent sold long enough”.  

All that being said, it can be super lucrative. Its just not for the faint of heart, and isnt nearly as easy to make money as the Amazon gold rush of 2014-2016 was.",1567042085,gimlet

I definitely understand if she’s looking for an easy way out of her current job but it’s not easy to make it.

Also there are tons of expensive “how to drop ship and quit your job!” courses that could entice her too... that’s how those sellers are making money now, not through sales. 

There is money to be made in e-commerce but you’ve really gotta have something for a niche audience that isn’t already oversaturated and that takes a lot of time to get your stuff noticed still.

anonymous47474747474,"i’ve literally never heard her say half the things you’re talking about. maybe she tweeted them or said them somewhere else but i’m only talking about the hour long video she posted

she got addicted heroin because her boyfriend broke the only promise that was holding their relationship together and then he offered it to her. she shouldntve accepted it but it was a moment of weakness and she didn’t truly understand what heroin does to people. living with an addict isn’t enough to understand how their brain works. a lot of young adults do drugs without knowing what addiction is and how addicted you can be to something. i don’t think it’s fair to blame someone’s addiction out of curiosity because LOTS of people assume they have a strong enough willpower to stop after they’ve tried a drug once or twice. she’s not the only one. and she didn’t even do it put or curiosity. she did it out of desperation. people don’t truly understand how addictive these substances can be. she even said that she didn’t understand why johnny wouldn’t stop using heroin because it was ruining their relationship. she didn’t know how addictive it was

anyway, i don’t think she’s taking proper accountability. i think lots of things out of her control influenced the situation to make it worse and there was only so much she could do... at least without proper guidance from others. but she did have the ability to make choices that could have prevented some or all of this from happening. like i said. she is really young and only two months sober. i don’t think she should be on twitter talking about addiction so much because she tends to tweet things without really thinking about it (or it seems that way cuz she deleted tweets pretty often) and could say something potentially harmful or wrong, and also because i just don’t think she’s super qualified to talk about it as much as she does ... which sounds kind of horrible to say since she’s an ex addict but if what you’re saying is true, then obviously she shouldn’t be talking about it so much.",1567013721,gimlet

 Also that she can't do kratom, because she has to take 70 pills every few hours, and that other people shouldn't do it either. Which while I know you can get addicted to it, it is much less harmful than prescription opioids, or heroin.

FirmSensualCod,"&gt;When an entire family is addicted to something the major factor at play is bad parenting, or poor family Dynamics.

I'm not saying bad parenting or dynamics can't come into it (they did in my family) but surely if entire families can be addicts this is a point in *favour* of addiction having a hereditary component? 

Like many things it's a nature AND nurture issue.

It's also fairly commonly known that alcoholism especially is inheritable. Our genetics are a lot more malleable than we used to think.

Having an addictive personality can manifest in a lot of different ways, so you may get someone in a family who is a heroin addict while someone else is a smoker, and someone else is an obsessive reader. They still share that factor that gives them escapist tendencies and a need for that dopamine rush. You might also get people in the same family who have addictions to different degrees of intensity. So one person could be unemployed living in a crack den and their cousin could be drinking two sixpacks a night but still maintain a job. Makes it harder to spot. 

Anyway. I also wanted to say, I have read your other comments and definitely agree with you--TND is an irresponsible pet owner and I too am sceptical that she is going to change.",1566725234,gimlet

When an entire family is addicted to something the major factor at play is bad parenting, or poor family Dynamics.

She lacks empathy for her pets which has been widely discussed in reference to the funeral of cheese and how she replaces her pets and keeps them in inadequate enclosures. She has a problem with hoarding, she seems to acknowledge it when there is enough backlash, but nothing changes. This time she said that she rehomed some of the pets, but I don't think she will stop getting more, I hope she does, but I think she won't.",1566507071,gimlet

WalletInMyOtherPants,"I can't recall if it was RA or TAL, but the anecdote you're referring to, I believe, is where they're talking about the experience of  a Cold War Russian who the US managed to flip, and offer asylum over here. When he went with his family to the grocery store for the first time he was convinced that the government had staged everything for his sake, because there was such a wealth of available produce--all shelves filled. 

What he was accustomed to was people attempting to arrive first thing to the store, and even then, the modest stock had already been picked over and so they could never count on most ingredients being available. 

I just in the past couple of months relistened to this episode kind of on accident, so I'm leaning toward it being a TAL episode, because there are so many, I often can't tell if I'm listening to one I've already heard until I'm deep into the episode, whereas with Reply All, I generally don't listen to rebroadcasts since I methodically went through every episode.

I would like to believe that she really is clean and and planning to work towards staying clean, its hard to not be scepticle since she lied about it all this while, deflecting it in every way possible, blaming it on others and even planning and plotting to lie to her mom and keep using drugs.
She is a smart person because she did plan everything well and fooled her mom strategically untill things got out of hand, even after that she was planning to get her mom to leave and then acquire and do drugs again. She even planned to check out after the mandatory 10 days and well, relapse. 


These type of videos are her strong point, redemption and regret style of it, not the first time she is doing it.

And im not joking when i said i was a big fan of her, i religiously  followed her uploads, from when she started out. And as sad as i feel to say this, her credibility as far as i am concerned, is gone. Everytime she made a similar video, she got flooded with support and sympathy, but nothing changed, she kept up the facade and stuck to her destructive ways of life.

I remember groaning with disappointment when I thought I was going to be listening to a 10-minute ad, so I get you. 

Almost all podcasts need to have sponsors, though, unless they want to depend on a pay-to-listen platform like Patreon. I feel like Gimlet tries really hard (maybe too hard, evidently?) to make sponsored content feel natural yet entertaining. I’m enjoying the Heavyweight Diaries much more than I anticipated; if they need sponsors, at least the content makes me laugh. 

Maybe it’s silly, but I’m always a little proud of Gimlet when I hear they have a really legit sponsor like Miller High Life or Honda or something. I remember the smaller sponsors they used to get... companies and products I’ve never heard of and would never use. I assume Miller High Life paid a pretty penny to get this Heavyweight miniseries, which means Jonathan and Heavyweight are doing well.

Dagon's Illusion - Series Summary

The hellish hurricane known as Katrina is bearing down on New Orleans. As it screams toward landfall, one man knows the truth about its origin and power. One man has seen the mighty Angel that was called from the depths to wreak destruction and rain new evil onto the world. That man is Robert Arthur Dagon, the leading mentalist and magician of his generation. But Dagon is much more than an illusionist. He is a spirit traveler who knows how to leave his body and enter unseen worlds. With his beautiful business partner, Ellison Carter, he owns the hottest magic nightclub in New Orleans. Dagon's Illusion is in a huge old Garden District mansion once called Maron House. Built by slaves, it is a place of ancient loveliness and grandeur and one of the most haunted buildings in America. On this night of shrieking destruction, the past and present crash together. Dimensional doors are thrown open that cannot be closed and a great conspiracy of evil finds a home in Dagon’s Illusion. Read the prophecies. Time is speeding up. The Invisible War of Eons is rushing toward the Final Conflict. A man who believes only in himself is about to face Dark Thrones.

SophieTheCat,"It's good to be skeptical.  Neither you or I have a crystal ball - we don't know how this will turn out.  But I have 2 counter points.  

Point 1.  Let's look at it from the company's standpoint.  Why would Foxconn spent an enormous amount of time and money negotiating, flying out to appear with Walker/Trump/Powers that be/etc...  Why are they spending a ton of money building factories, buying buildings, etc..?  To just pull out?  That makes no sense. They are not getting the tax subsidies unless they spend far more money.  And if that happens, they just lost a bunch of money simply buying buildings.  

Point 2.  The alternative (for the govt) is just to sit on your butt, because all the ""turmoil"" might not be worth it at the end.  5 years ago, Obama promoted the hell out of Solyndra solar company.  The company got actual money from the government (not tax subsidies).  And it failed spectacularly and managed to cause taxpayers over half a billion in losses.  I still thought the investment was worth it cause you miss 100% of the shots you don't take and sometimes you just fail.

I’m sure they want to make good content, but with kids and the ball and chain it takes a ton of focus and long hours to pull off some of the brilliant episodes they’ve put out in the past. 

They’ve also been associated with Spotify which is some big FU money.  You look at boxers who got that one big match And they’re now set for life. Later on they’re just coasting by to survive and not get hurt. Those are some boring matches, but it’s the responsible thing to do.

I would imagine identity politics might have something to do with it as well. Reply All is one episode away from speaking unpopular truth and their advertisers could pull out of Spotify altogether. Someone’s head would roll and there you go, how do you pay for diapers and a mortgage? We live in a political climate with a huge PC-ness and it’s possible Reply All is limited as to what they can say and do without offending the socially-outraged SJW Digital Mob who’s hobby is to cancel people overnight.

Dagon's Illusion - Series Summary

The hellish hurricane known as Katrina is bearing down on New Orleans. As it screams toward landfall, one man knows the truth about its origin and power. One man has seen the mighty Angel that was called from the depths to wreak destruction and rain new evil onto the world. That man is Robert Arthur Dagon, the leading mentalist and magician of his generation. But Dagon is much more than an illusionist. He is a spirit traveler who knows how to leave his body and enter unseen worlds. With his beautiful business partner, Ellison Carter, he owns the hottest magic nightclub in New Orleans. Dagon's Illusion is in a huge old Garden District mansion once called Maron House. Built by slaves, it is a place of ancient loveliness and grandeur and one of the most haunted buildings in America. On this night of shrieking destruction, the past and present crash together. Dimensional doors are thrown open that cannot be closed and a great conspiracy of evil finds a home in Dagon’s Illusion. Read the prophecies. Time is speeding up. The Invisible War of Eons is rushing toward the Final Conflict. A man who believes only in himself is about to face Dark Thrones.

CozyAmigo,"Another scenario to consider
""Because of the way the contract structures subsidies, Foxconn could game it by employing few people and investing heavily in automation, costing taxpayers more than $500,000 per job.""
""Even if Foxconn fails to hit its subsidy targets, Wisconsin taxpayers will be out a lot of money. The state has already spent hundreds of millions on land and infrastructure for the project, costs that go to waste if the company simply walks away. Furthermore, the way the contract is structured means Wisconsin could end up paying more per job if Foxconn hires fewer people.

The capital investment portion of the subsidy package is pegged to hiring, but not in the same way as the jobs subsidies. While Foxconn doesn’t get any hiring subsidies if it fails to meet employment thresholds, it can still get subsidies for its investments in buildings and equipment, minus whatever percentage it missed its job target by.

For example, if Foxconn only employs 260 people at the end of this year, half its minimum target, but invests $1 billion in construction, Wisconsin could end up paying Foxconn almost $300,000 per job. Other scenarios take the cost per job above $500,000.""

CozyAmigo,"Tbh i'm skeptical that it will even be 1500 jobs and I'm sceptical that it they will be long-term enough for the state to see the value.  So you've made a lot of assumptions and if they all true out to be right (which they could be, they're not unreasonable) the state will start to see some benefit 10 years. That's likely the best case scenario, that they slightly profit off it. I still don't believe that will happen and wouldn't be surprised if foxconn pulled out completely at some point. It will be interesting to follow it and see if they actually do start seeing the benefit. Doesn't really seem worth the forced property acquisitions and all the turmoil",1564436465,gimlet

Houstons-Problem,"I don't know the specifics of this break, but PJ and Alex do tend to go on quite lengthy breaks from time to time. Like, months at a time.

SophieTheCat,"I don't believe you are looking at a larger picture.  

Assuming they will only ever create permanent 1500 jobs (which Foxconn denies, btw - they are saying 13k is still the target) and let's say they are high tech paying 100k a year and keep them for 10 years (lots of assumptions, i know).  

1500 jobs * 100k = $150 million in salaries per year 
$150m * 6.27% (income tax bracket for 100k) = $9.4 million

$9.4m * 10 years = $94 million.

So the state will take in $94 million in income taxes.  

Now, let's assume that the 1500 people will spend 20% of their salaries on buying things (low estimate, i think).  At 5% sales tax (150m * 20% * 5% * 10 years), it will be $15 million.  So that makes it $109m.

Now let's add adjacent jobs (e.g. construction of factories, cafes and restaurants, supplier chain, etc...) which is typically more than the actual place itself - with these 1500 jobs - I think the state will definitely get its money back and more.",1564340429,gimlet

4.) Foreign Fake ID - I enjoyed this part of the show. 

5.) Bored To Death - The episode could have been without this segment. Less is more. 

6.) Fellow Shower Sitter - I’m growing tired of all the fanfare of the obsession over Alex sitting in the shower.

7.) Finstagram - This was more or less the same as the first segment of the show. A Finstagram was the most obvious solution that even a cavemen could conclude. 

7.) Printers.sucks - This was mildly interesting but thank goodness for a follow up to this’s 
8.) Moana Spotify - Simple problems call for simple answers.
9.) Moana Spotify Answers - Read the above
10.) Printers.sucks Answers - I thoroughly enjoyed this part of the episode.  Learning about printers was nerdy but that is a great example of making lemonade with lemons mix

intrsectionalfascism,"They undermined their own message by choosing a victim from Vox, pretty much the poster child for shitty Progressive propaganda. I’m sure they could have found a legitimate media site that was being harassed.

Whenever progressives talk about punching Nazis, they *always* say that freedom of speech doesn’t protect you from the consequences of your speech. Yet when they experience it, they always appeal to authorities to shut down opposing viewpoints.

Insomuch as “racist” and “fascist” and “hate speech” have become shorthand for “something a progressive doesn’t like but cannot articulate an argument against that will win in the marketplace of ideas”, the problem is that the line is drawn so far to the left that bystanders become the victims of violence simply for being there. Heck, they even assaulted the liberal old lady who showed up to debate Charles Murray! The victim/oppressor dichotomy combined with intersectionality allows anyone to become the subject of violence. This is why I call Progressivism “Intersectional Fascism”

Still, I don’t blame Reply All for wanting to get at the underlying algorithms that radicalize people. That’s the real story here. Efforts to engineer society always backfire, as humans have an innate and fierce desire to be free. Monopolies like facebook and twitter undercut their own hegemony when they attempt to control the conversation towards their political ends, opening the door for better and free-er platforms.

Shows I’m listening to:

Dark Net Diaries tells stories about hackers. This one is probably my favorite right now. Jack does a great job translating complex topics and stories to ELI5 making them interesting and compelling. Start with one of the recent episodes then go back and listen to the all. The content is consistent and regularly produced.

Aria Code is about opera. Even if you aren’t a fan, it perfectly blends music and storytelling. They select a different song and professional musicians tell the story and explain what makes each piece so complex. Then you listen to the song in entirety afterward able to understand it.

A Very Fatal Murder is a fictional series by The Onion meant to jump of the murder mystery bandwagon. Episodes are really short and funny.  Very easy to listen to and worth starting from the beginning.

Caliphate by the NYT researches and tells the story of ISIS. Definitely interesting journalism.

How I Built This by NPR interviews founders of famous companies you’ve heard of and tells the story how how they came to be.

Revisionist History by Malcom Gladwell is pretty interesting. I’m not sure how to describe it as he’s one of those over the top literary types. However I do find the stories interesting. I think I first heard about him on Tim Ferris’ podcast.

The Uncertain Hour by NPR is pretty good. Their tag line is “the things we argue the most about are the things we know the least about”.

kennycosgrove,"And, btw, I didn't just bring up PJ and Alex's voice to say ""Maza sounds totally straight."" I think the defining feature of Maza's voice is similar to the defining feature of a lot of modern public radio or public radio-adjacent male voices. Alex Blumberg and Ira Glass are even better examples of it than PJ and Alex Goldman: it's a front of the mouth, deliberate speech pattern. I personally don't associate it with homosexuality, but it's also not a ""traditionally masculine"" way of speaking.",1563917462,gimlet
kennycosgrove,"Nope, I'm not saying that at all. I'm acknowledging that ""gay voice"" is a thing that some, but not all gay men have. Carlos Maza's voice is maybe a 2 on the ""gay voice"" spectrum. 

Like I said, I feel yucky assigning value to ""how gay"" someone's voice is, because I know plenty of men with more effeminate or ""gay sounding"" voices who are straight, and I know plenty of gay men with traditionally masculine voices. But why I'm willing to specify that Maza's voice is not particularly effeminate (and how this thread began talking about the weird use of the word lisp) is because Steven Crowder's impression of him is more like an 8 on the spectrum. Which  suggests the voice he is doing is rooted in homophobia, not impression. If Maza actually sounded like Charles Nelson Reilly, and Crowder did an impression of him that sounded like Charles Nelson Reilly, it would be harder to call that hate speech. But because Maza doesn't have that voice, Crowder's over-the-top impression feels homophobic. I do think that's very relevant. It would be like if someone, when doing an impression of Barack Obama, did a Al Jolson style ""black voice.""",1563917290,gimlet

All the without fail episodes start with Alex talks to.  I think startup doesn't do reruns like other podcast because the best seasons are linked multi episodes.

Podcasts consistency is best",1563850417,gimlet
kalecake,"Hmm, I can't agree. You're right that TV shows often show re-runs absent new content, and that is indeed what many podcasts do--for a Gimlet quintessential example, see Reply All which reposts old eps when they don't have new content so that they have a consistent Thursday update in their feed. I wouldn't care if StartUp re-posted favorite old StartUp episodes and had no objection when they did that for a little while (re-airing ""listener favorites"" or whatever they did a while back).

Podcasts with strong listener base don't need to do the same thing as appointment television to keep folks engaged on a regular basis, though, because subscribing means the content is delivered when it's pushed by the creators, and I would guess that most folks don't actively unsubscribe when a season ends for a show they otherwise like. For another successful Gimlet example see Heavyweight, which has also not dropped new content for 7 months but in this case with a dormant feed, and as soon as he drops new content you bet folks will still be there and ready to listen. For a TV example see basically everything that runs on a season, which airs regularly for a while and then goes quiet for the summer or some months, and yet once new episodes are ready you bet that folks are still ready to watch Game Of Thrones again even though they hadn't been sitting down to HBO every Sunday night in the meantime.

Above all, though, TV networks do _not_ use one show's time slot to run episodes of other shows. Folks don't see Frasier in their TV guide and then turn it on only to find out that it's unexpectedly a Seinfeld episode--that would be a betrayal of trust for Frasier fans, and Seinfeld fans wouldn't have known to go watch what was advertised as Frasier, and that leaves the advertisers in that half hour slot (who are paying the networks) with confused and disengaged viewers. Networks do of course shows ads or previews for their other TV shows--which again, Gimlet podcasts do in their ad blocks plenty of the time, and that's not the objection either.

But no, I don't think a bait and switch is an effective way to get an engaged and positive listener base, and it's not what traditional TV or other successful podcast networks do.",1563849101,gimlet
tfresca,I think from their perspective it's better to have people actively looking at the feed rather than not looking at the feed because they aren't getting new content. I'm sure they've tried it both ways and this way is better of numbers. TV networks don't go black when a show is out of new episodes. They show re-runs and cross-promote other shows.,1563848045,gimlet
kalecake,"""It's free so don't complain about it"" and ""if you don't like it ignore it"" aren't especially worthwhile arguments. If someone promised you a trained butterfly show and then told you the butterflies were hibernating so instead followed you around with a free swarm of houseflies for 7 months, and you could just swat the buzzing fly swarm away from your head if you didn't want it but it would show up next week, that still wouldn't be especially kind of them and you would still tell them to stop, right?

Using StartUp as a second Without Fail feed just negates the point of having two feeds so it's not benefitting anyone. StartUp listeners who don't like WF have to manually delete a thing they didn't ask for and lose goodwill towards Gimlet. WF listeners who don't like StartUp hopefully have subscribed to the WF feed so they don't even see this happening. Listeners who like both are hopefully also subscribed to WF in which case this is duplication and an annoyance, _or_ this has actually stopped them from needing to subscribe to WF in which case that feed's downloads/listen rates aren't the whole picture which can't make Gimlet's marketing numbers easier.

I'm all for cross-promotion and I often go subscribe to another show after hearing a cross-promoted episode that got me interested! But you get one--MAYBE two--of another show's episodes in your feed, otherwise it's not really a StartUp feed anymore and instead just an Alex Blumberg feed, which isn't what listeners signed up for.

In this case the very minor annoyance of deleting an episode I didn't ask for every week eventually outweighed the semi-minor goodwill I had towards the quality of the show. I've already unsubscribed from StartUp.",1563847518,gimlet

People quote the ""who are the marxist""-quote, but I very much love a line from his opening statement: 

&gt;It is today’s capitalism that equalizers us too much and causes the loss of many talents. So what about the balance of equality and hierarchy? Did we really move too much in the direction of equality? Is there, in today’s United States, really too much equality? I think a simple overview of the situation points in the opposite direction. Far from pushing us too far, the Left is gradually losing its ground already for decades. Its trademarks: universal health care, free education, and so on, are continually diminished. Look at Bernie Sanders’ - ,and  i don't idealize him -, program.

&amp;#x200B;

*""Smart Out Loud: How Janice Bryant Howroyd Learned to Own Her Brilliance""* was one of the best in my opinion, similar themes of race and gender are explored in this episode.      

&amp;#x200B;

 It seems like an entirely different show compared to this episode. This episode stops feeling like a candid back and forth and more ""The Daily"" kind of zone: stilted and weird, there is no real discussion, Alex is reduced to a nervous yes-man, the guest seems to have their story (?)  completely rehearsed with a dead-eyed smile., . 

&amp;#x200B;

It does feel extra weird having ad-reads for kinda-shady- corporate sponsors (amazon, I think) sandwiched within this kind of an episode, very weird neoliberal vibes. 

&amp;#x200B;

ganowicz,"&gt; So you're fine with companies dictating what goes on their websites. They can block abusive or hateful messages aimed at a specific group.

Yes.

&gt; Let's call this hate speech.

No. This is specifically what I object to. Let me make an analogy here to help you understand how I think about this issue. Most conservatives believe abortion is murder. Most people on the left strenuously disagree. Imagine conservatives insisting you refer to abortion as murder. Now imagine those same conservatives insisting that they don't intend to make abortion illegal, they just want you to refer to it as murder. Would you comply with their request to refer to abortion as murder?

&gt; Is what you're afraid of, the idea of the government misusing the term in order to limit citizens speech?

I don't think they would be misusing the term at all. My position is that those using the term hate speech when referring to the policies of private actors are misusing the term. The concept of hate speech has always been tied to legal restrictions on speech. Hate speech is a relatively new term, and it's fairly straightforward to track its origins. The term originates in a 1989 article in the Michigan Law Review by law professor Mari J. Matsuda titled ""[Public Response to Racist Speech: Considering the Victim's Story.](http://fs2.american.edu/dfagel/www/Class%20Readings/Matsuda/Response%20To%20Racist%20Speech.pdf)""

The thesis of the article is as such:

&gt;  ""Professor Richard Delgado recognized the
 harm of racist speech in his breakthrough article, 'Words That
 Wound,' in which he suggested a tort remedy for injury from racist
 words. This Article takes inspiration from Professor Delgado's position, and makes the further suggestion that formal criminal and administrative sanction - public as opposed to private prosecution - is
 also an appropriate response to racist speech.


&gt;  In making this suggestion, this Article moves between two stories.
 The first is the victim's story of the effects of racist hate messages. The
 second is the first amendment's story of free speech. The intent is to
 respect and value both stories. This bipolar discourse uses as method
 what many outsider intellectuals do in silence: it mediates between
 different ways of knowing in order to determine what is true and what
 is just.


&gt; In calling for legal sanctions for racist speech, this Article rejects
 an absolutist first amendment position. It calls for movement of the
 societal response to racist speech from the private to the public realm""




This is the context in which the term hate speech was first used - a demand that racist speech be met with government sanction. This is the thing I oppose, and I believe the popularization of the term hate speech lays the cultural groundwork for adopting such a standard into US law. I firmly believe that politics is downstream of culture. Tomorrow's Supreme Court justices are today's college students. The values that exist in the popular consciousness now will eventually be reflected in law.",1563311704,gimlet

HotCategory3,"&gt; This guy basically used the podcast to create a false narrative to drum up support in his effort to de-platform and silence anyone critical of him or even just his side of the political aisle.

&gt; He really plays up this sob story of bullying and how he just wants to be a journalist and for people to be nicer but after looking him up he's a completely disingenuous hypocrite. He calls for violence on twitter and his biggest journalistic piece is being an antifa apologist, dismissing criticism and defending them.

Because that's what Maza does. He calls for violence against people who disagree with him and then comes back crying wolf when Crowder debunks/argues against his ideas alongside a bit of comedic spice. I mean, he's being bullied by Crowder because Crowder calls them a *lispy queer*. And the funny thing is that instead of replying to Crowder fair and head-on, he goes to Twitter to try to de-platform Crowder along with others YT creators who had nothing to do with it.

For those people on this thread who just came across this whole Maza-Crowder debacle, I encourage you to watch some YT videos about the whole thing and form an opinion from that. I won't link any videos but if I had to recommend a person in particular, Tim Pool provides a fair takedown of the whole incident.

&gt; You can't cheer on a group that actually physically harasses and assaults people (and directly call for people to do it) and then play the innocent traumatized victim when people say mean things about you on the internet.

You won't believe it but some people don't consider this violence. At worst, it might be called a *minor inconvenience*. Referring to somebody as a *lispy queer* is more violent that throwing milkshakes at people. Who've thunk it?",1563289776,gimlet

Championing the ex-Media-Matters-militant and current Antifa-violence-advocate Carlos Maza, and here, dedicating an episode to this known race-baiting tantrum-thrower famous for getting into fisticuffs with an Uber driver, claiming Jussie Smollett may still be ""wrongly accused"" even after his arrest, and dragging/recruiting kids into the identitarian mire.

Alex, do you do an iota of research on these people? Would such research even give you pause, ever? I somehow doubt it at this point.

And to be clear, I think it's not only wrong but also not funny to make low effort jabs like Crowder did.

Hate speech has a clear definition and they should take down videos that use it and target it at people and ban repeat offenders. This wouldn't constitute anywhere near half of youtube but a very vocal minority. And if they started taking the videos down maybe these people would start to realise you can debate politics without using racist or homophobic attacks (probably not but worth a try). Yes they have put themselves in this position but they could get out of it by taking a very clear stand on hate speech. Then you could also make the point that if tackling hate speech is the same as conservative censorship then that means that the conservative mindset equates to biggotry which I think the majority of right wing people wouldn't want to agree with.

Crowder isn't responsible (insofar as he didn't directly call for them) for the actions of his fans, including their harassment of Maza. This episode links Crowder (honestly a pretty mainstream conservative commentator), the alt-right, and abusive/harassing fans together into some kind of monolith.

In my opinion, YouTube messed this up big-time for demonetizing Crowder for essentially being an asshole. They themselves admitted he wasn't breaking rules because his content wasn't primarily aimed at harassing Maza. In truth, it was barely a blurb. He mentions him for a few minutes at most in his 30-60 minute videos.

If he didn't break the rules, he shouldn't be demonetized and if he did, he should be deplatformed. This wishy-washy outcome tells me they don't give two shits about Crowder or Maza or their own rules.",1562975912,gimlet

ClockOfTheLongNow,"&gt; Carlos faces death threats because Crowder attacks him personally. He risks losing his life if someone is serious.

&gt; And Crowder can choose to move onto a new target.

Crowder may lose his channel, Carlos is getting empty threats. I'll stick with my perspective on this one.

&gt; People make threats to scare someone. The threat is scary because you don’t know who is serious.

But people generally aren't serious, that's the obvious point that's being missed here. No one is considering them credible, and we probably call more threats credible than they really are.

&gt; Where do you draw the line on what crosses the line or when someone needs a thicker skin? You can’t say there is no line without saying pure racist vitriol is fine and people who don’t like it just need to toughen up.

I don't think there's an objective line, and I don't need to believe racist vitriol is fine to say that. There's a difference between people tolerating the right to say racist things and endorsing the language. We've often forgotten that as of late.

&gt; Certain protected classes have faced so much real life consequences tied to certain words that when they hear those words, it’s an indication they are at risk. Someone says “hey fag” and punches you 20 times, you’re going to associate that word with a physical threat.

I'm not victim blaming here, to be clear, but if you cannot move past trauma in your past, it is not up to third parties to sanitize the world as a result. If the issue with Carlos is that he associates those words with assault, he needs a therapist and not a YouTube moderator.

&gt; But Crowder chose to focus on a few people and picked Carlos. Why?

I don't know the answer to this off-hand, and Reply All chose not to explore it.

So I did some research. First, Carlos worked for Media Matters before Vox, which really should have been disclosed in the podcast. It shows that Carlos is as extreme on the left hand side of the aisle as Crowder is on the right, and this may have been the root of it but all the stories seem to start at Carlos raising the issue, so I can't tell where or why it started.

&gt; And he chose to make the attack on more than just his ideas.

Crowder is under no obligation to be polite. I feel it weakens his arguments, but that's just me. YouTube commentary isn't my cup of tea.

&gt; This isn’t a conservative/liberal media conflict story. That’s not the story they wanted to tell.

It's not a media conflict story, but the media conflict story is *crucial* to the understanding of the way this went down. If Carlos doesn't work for Vox and MMFA, Crowder likely never goes after him and there's no story.

&gt; This is a YouTube policy story and these are the players.

And my point is that YouTube policy issues are better served with a different story than this one, especially when key facts are left out.

How about the monetization/hate speech/harassment issues with gaming YouTube, for example?  There's much less political background there and it achieves the same goal. Unfortunately, there's not an identity politics angle there, so...

&gt; It’s a story of how bullying behavior isn’t going to be policed by YouTube’s anti-bullying policy because it doesn’t have any real teeth

Then we should be clear that this being a story on YouTube policy is similarly weak, because it spends little time on demonstrating this. The closest it comes is noting that YouTube looks at overall context, but since the episode failed to give us the proper context of how the Crowder/Carlos conflict began, it just sounds as if YouTube is being neglectful about the whole thing.

&gt; YouTube’s own algorithms promoted extremists and gave them a voice and they can use that to bully people so long as they mix in enough regular content.

Of all this, it's never established that Crowder is bullying anyone. He's a rude media critic, but criticism (especially of public figures like Carlos) is not bullying.

A case can be made that Crowder's followers are harassing Carlos. That's not Crowder's problem, though, and not one any policy or algorithm can solve.

&gt; You seem to think painting him as a little guy made it look like bullying...

It did, for the record. And I don't know if that was the intention or not. I hope not.

&gt; Focusing more on his videos coming from Vox would have muddied the story they wanted to tell and made it about Vox vs conservative media.

If context ruins the story, *the story is bad*. That's my whole point here. If you're missing key information, how is this at all a useful exercise?",1562878462,gimlet

so_witty_username_v2,"Whether he is alt-right or not isn't the deciding factor though. If you're such a rational thinker, as Crowder seems to portray himself as, then surely you can see how attacking a particular individual not on the basis of his ideas but also using his looks, sexuality, and lifestyle does constitute harassment and possibly hate speech - at the very least under the rules of the platform as written, if not for common sense people.",1562876914,gimlet
WinterOfFire,"&gt; It's more Crowder than Carlos, frankly. Carlos can put up a video whenever he wants, while Crowder runs the risk of losing part of his livelihood due to the acts of others who watch him.

Carlos faces death threats because Crowder attacks him personally.  He risks losing his life if someone is serious.

And Crowder can choose to move onto a new target.  He can focus on picking apart Carlos’ ideas.  He chooses to attack him personally and focus on him.  He made the focus personal.  Carlos didn’t respond to his videos for a long time.  He runs the risk of losing his livelihood because he chooses to bully someone else and not only attracts but actively cultivated his type of listener.  

&gt; (Another great topic for a podcast could be how death threats are so commonplace on the internet and how we still treat them as significant and credible in spite of that reality.)

People make threats to scare someone.  The threat is scary because you don’t know who is serious.  People who aren’t serious are trading on the idea that it might be real.  That is still a serious act.  I wave a gun at someone that isn’t loaded... does that mean it wasn’t illegal?  Most people don’t take them seriously until they see something that indicates the person took it offline.  Either comments about their routine, family, car, house.  Carlos’ personal cell phone number was being circulated and actively used.

&gt; Carlos appears to be internalizing the situation more than he probably should. Another avenue the podcast could have gone down is about when a public figure gets attacked or mobbed.

This is a tough one.  Where do you draw the line on what crosses the line or when someone needs a thicker skin?  You can’t say there is no line without saying pure racist vitriol is fine and people who don’t like it just need to toughen up.  

In my own opinion it comes down to how pervasive the attitude is and what real-world consequences someone faces.  Being openly gay in 2019 may not be as risky as it was in 1980.  But it’s not risk-free.  

Red-heads or people who wear glasses get teased but they don’t get ostracized from their family, churches, lose jobs. (Ginger hatred has grown though so who knows what job consequences they may face).

This is similar to the death threat issue.  Certain protected classes have faced so much real life consequences tied to certain words that when they hear those words, it’s an indication they are at risk.  Someone says “hey fag” and punches you 20 times, you’re going to associate that word with a physical threat.

&gt; Vox has been a target of conservative media criticism for years for a host of reasons, and Crowder is contributing in part to that area of media criticism. It matters.
 
I can see how that put Carlos on their radar.  And Vox is targeted as a whole.  But Crowder chose to focus on a few people and picked Carlos.  Why?  And he chose to make the attack on more than just his ideas.  

My high school may have a rivalry with another high school and there is a history or pranks.  So maybe I only noticed their water boy because of the team rivalry but what I do from there still matters.  How I choose to attack him, the focus, making it personal, picking something sensitive like race or sexuality, and how long I keep targeting him are all choices that get made that are NOT part of rivalry.  The rivalry is an excuse for behavior that isn’t acceptable.

This isn’t a conservative/liberal media conflict story.  That’s not the story they wanted to tell.  This is a YouTube policy story and these are the players.  Yes, he worked at Vox.  It’s not even a story about how bullying people for being gay is wrong.  

It’s a story of how bullying behavior isn’t going to be policed by YouTube’s anti-bullying policy because it doesn’t have any real teeth.  YouTube’s own algorithms promoted extremists and gave them a voice and they can use that to bully people so long as they mix in enough regular content.   

You seem to think painting him as a little guy made it look like bullying... you don’t have to be a little guy to get bullied.   The story would be the same if it was Anderson Cooper being bullied... these were the people with a public story that ran into this issue.  Focusing more on his videos coming from Vox would have muddied the story they wanted to tell and made it about Vox vs conservative media.

galewolf,"No, I think because the algorithm recognizes that they are unique characteristics to videos.

But it's not just controversial content - behind the scenes the algorithm has always automatically connected subjects together, e.g. the Last Jedi. So you start out on something normal (like the official Last Jedi trailer), and end up in a full blown alt-right channel with someone ranting about SJWs. Then because you're watching that channel, it keeps recommending more until you hit your limit on crazy.

What's bizarre to think about is no one is sitting there making the decision to connect the videos together, so the algorithm is able to make all sorts of connections, before they're rammed through to viewers by weird recommendation metrics (watch time, click through rate etc.).

I explicitly disavow such potential interpretations at least three times in the comments above. But I'm glad you hijacked the thread with obscene interpretations.

&gt; This wasn’t a national story because a random Youtuber was bullied, it became a national story because there was a public attempt to shame YouTube into changing content policies. That’s a fascinating dynamic and this episode doesn’t do it justice.

***the moderation decision*** and ***the speech issues*** are more complicated because of the involvement of significant public figures. Ignoring Vox allows the episode to completely skip over a massive amount of interesting issues relating to regulating political speech. 

It strains credulity to believe that I was merely saying ""I am morally justified in calling you a **** because you work at a culturally significant institution."" It's bullshit and you know it.

**********************


&gt; Well, it's evident because people like Steven Crowder

nope. [This moral intuition isn't about Crowder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_figure). 

&gt;&gt; In the context of defamation actions (libel and slander) as well as invasion of privacy, a public figure cannot succeed in a lawsuit on incorrect harmful statements in the United States unless there is proof that the writer or publisher acted with actual malice by knowing the falsity or by reckless disregard for the truth.[2] The legal burden of proof in defamation actions is thus higher in the case of a public figure than in the case of an ordinary person. 

I don't want to specifically limit this concept to the legal standard, I just want to use it to illustrate what I took to be an obvious point. The standards of civility and good faith when attacking private figures are significantly more narrow than when aiming at public ones. Again, note that we're not dealing with what is morally righteous, we're dealing with what is permitted and (again) note that this is a general point not one saying Crowder did nothing wrong.",1562867862,gimlet

ClockOfTheLongNow,"&gt; Again, we could really get into the weeds with this one but I strongly disagree. I think this is a wildly unsophisticated view of this issue though as clearly violence is NOT necessary for others to take hate speech as legitimate.

I think it's unsophisticated and censorious to treat speech as anything but speech, but we're not going to come to a conclusion on this today. I'm willing to keep going with it, but it's fairly off-topic (especially since Ngo, who experienced the violence, was not engaging in or promoting hate speech, but the accusation was levied anyway and he paid for it in violence. See the problem?).

&gt; have to ask, do you know any journalists or have worked in media? How do you know they didn't?

I do. I assume they didn't because they explicitly said that Crowder didn't comment. If they reached out for comment anywhere else, it's a reasonable assumption that they would have commented to that effect as well.

&gt; Additionally I'm not sure how one of those people would have added to the story when to me this was a personal piece more about the weirdness surrounding Youtubes algorithm and how it impacted a single person

That's the point, right?  If it's about the algorithm, there are better stories out there. If it's about a victim, there are better victims. The attempt to combine the two in this episode comes across as ideological axe-griding.

&gt; What context could there be to make ANYTHING Crowder said in this episode okay?

Without hearing anything in context, I don't know for sure.

Even so, we don't need to endorse the speech or believe it's okay to understand it or even accept that it exists.

&gt; What are the important parts?

I think I've detailed this. The algorithm, internet mobs, harassment. If the story is Crowder versus Carlos, the Vox perception and media criticism on the internet is a major point that is not even touched upon.

&gt; It honestly sounds like you just wanted this episode to be something different than it was.

Well, I listen to Reply All for quality journalism on topics with a tech or internet angle. I got journalism with an internet angle, but it was low quality this time.

&gt; That's totally fair but the way it's inserted into your point makes it sound like its somehow unfair which again gets back to your expectation.

I don't see how this can be considered a fair take on the topic. It ignores far too much context in all areas. My expectation is higher quality content than what we got.",1562863209,gimlet
ClockOfTheLongNow,"&gt;They did not give the impression that he was a random vlogger.

I fully disagree. Vox is dropped in at the top without context, and mentioned by Colbert in one of the clips. That's it.

You cannot tell this story and diminish the role that Vox as an institution plays in the criticism of Carlos. Vox has been a target of conservative media criticism for years for a host of reasons, and Crowder is contributing in part to that area of media criticism. It matters.

&gt; The reason Carlos is the focus of the story is that he is personally affected by it and he chose to call out YouTube on twitter. Whoever he worked for in creating the content isn’t fighting this fight, he is.

And thus the root of the problem. The focus of the story is completely off, in part due to the attempt to center Carlos around it without discussing the context of how his videos hit Crowder's radar.

&gt; Let’s say someone took a picture of me working at Starbucks and it turned into a meme mocking me. If I speak up for being mocked, somehow the story is about Starbucks?

It depends on the context, honestly. Is the meme a criticism of you or about broader Starbucks policy?  The latter is a major topic of discussion, after all, and the context behind what's happening might actually matter.

You bring up a good point here, though. Carlos appears to be internalizing the situation more than he probably should. Another avenue the podcast could have gone down is about when a public figure gets attacked or mobbed. Instead, again, they treat Carlos not as a public journalist, but instead some sort of vlogger. That's key context lost in the noise.

&gt; And let’s be clear. Carlos has stopped making videos because he will be personally attacked, his family and his life threatened. Those threats come from the audience that learned about him from YouTube. He is not complaining about the critiques of his content. He is complaining about the bullying over his sexuality. His sexuality made him a rich target for mocking repeatedly.

And this is unfortunate, and a major problem. And it happens a lot, and not just to minorities of any stripe.  There is nothing special to Carlos's story per se that couldn't be told better from different perspectives. Like, for instance, Andy Ngo, who has actually encountered violence for his journalism.

(Another great topic for a podcast could be how death threats are so commonplace on the internet and how we still treat them as significant and credible in spite of that reality.)

&gt; Someone’s ability to speak their mind is being suppressed here... it’s not Crowder.

It's more Crowder than Carlos, frankly. Carlos can put up a video whenever he wants, while Crowder runs the risk of losing part of his livelihood due to the acts of others who watch him.

&gt; And this isn’t a first amendment issue for Carlos either.

ClockOfTheLongNow,"&gt; respect you don't want to hash this out but again, I have to ask what can we do then if we allow hate speech in the first place? Certainly violence is not an ideal response but hate speech by its nature is an attempt to incite violence.

I don't agree that hate speech is inherently an incitement of violence, to start. I also think we're exceptionally bad at recognizing hate speech and tend to cast a wide net when addressing it.

Still, we have a firm American principle of defending the right of people to speak their mind. What can you do? Respect their right to say it, and either respond with better speech or ignore their speech and let them scream into a void. Violence in response simply legitimizes the speech, and runs counter to the best practices of handling it.

&gt; I understand this criticism but I'm struggling to see how they could have further explored Crowder's side of the story evenly if Crowder himself did not choose to comment.

Apparently there are legions of Crowder acolytes doing his dirty work for him. They couldn't find one to talk to about Crowder, about their dislike of Vox or Carlos, or... anything? Nobody around?

&gt; have you considered that Crowder's position is simply indefensible?

No, I haven't, because I'm not convinced that's true in this context. But we'd never know that one way or the other based on this podcast, right? And the hosts definitely don't present it as indefensible. I would at least be able to acknowledge it as ""we didn't ask for comment because we don't see the point,"" but they express making at least a cursory effort to get comment. I believe they could have (and should have) done more.

&gt; Isn't discussing how Crowder is winning financially discussing his perspective?

Not unless we think Crowder exists only for merch sales. I doubt his videos are 30 minutes of shilling t-shirts.

Heck, from listening to the episode, how does anyone even get an idea of what Crowder does?  If I didn't know him before, I just know him as a YouTuber who attacks minorities and interviews personalities that a lot of the internet despises. That's... not much to go on.

(And the episode isn't exactly fair to Carlos on this either. By diminishing his role at Vox, it means we don't understand that he's actually a voice considered credible, and by reducing him to a queer minority, his agency goes out the window.)

I'd also argue that you should read up more on this specific story, as there's a lot of detail out there that wasn't explored.

That the most important parts of this story were ignored in favor of yet another surface-level story about alt-right content on the internet.

Apparently channel operators get ~55% of ad revenue for ads shown on their videos, and CPMs seem to be in the $7.50 range. Conservatively assuming each subscriber translates into just 2 ad views on average each month -- *very* conservative here, as I'd assume most for this kind of stuff are very ardent viewers and there's all the ""fly by"" viewers not even acknowledged just looking at subscribers  -- that'd be

Let's be clear. It's not uneven because it didn't cover a similar situation. It's uneven because it approaches the subject solely from one side and ignored an example that does a better job of expressing a point about internet videos, mob responses, and victimization. You could have also gone into detail about callout culture instead.

A slapfight between a media personality and a media critic framed not around the personalty's profession but around his identity portrayed as a harassment exercise by the critic and his followers is not an accurate story nor does it begin to give the proper context. It's bad journalism, it's bad commentary, and it makes for a bad episode where listeners will end the podcast less informed than they were 35 minutes earlier.

There's also an interesting story about how the YouTube algorithm works. It's more interesting that YouTube is [likely contributing to the increase in flat earth believers] (https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/17/study-blames-youtube-for-rise-in-number-of-flat-earthers), and would make a better episode because nearly everyone can agree that this is nuts. Instead, the focus is on ""alt-right"" content? I wonder why...

&gt; Carlos is still under heavy amounts of death threats and harassment while demonetizing Crowder has only gotten him more fans and not really halted his revenue stream which is mostly merchandise.

This is maybe the only interesting part of the episode for me, and more because it shows how much YouTube has really messed up in its moderation.

throwawaynumber53,"&gt; YouTube has no choice but to allow Crowder to speak on some level. Otherwise they risk pissing off conservative members of congress that have the power to eventually reclassify YouTube as public utility. 

That's not how utilities, or Congress, work. Congress isn't going to classify a single video hosting site as a public utility! That's not how any of this works! How would that even work in practice? Do you honestly want the US government to run a video hosting site? How many money would taxpayers have to pay to keep Youtube running?

What you're thinking of is ""common carriers"" and that's where private businesses like airplanes or hotels are required to accept pretty much anyone; but even then, common carriers can reject people for being violent or breaking the rules or causing a disturbance. And it's been a massive fight even to get *Internet Service Providers* to be classified as common carriers, something conservatives have fought against bitterly and successfully got Ajit Pai to kill (remember the whole Net Neutrality thing?), so the idea that Congress is going to go and turn Youtube into a common carrier is just pure fantasy.

&gt;What upsets me is the erosion of the first amendment. 

That's also not how the First Amendment works! It only applies to the *government*. Private businesses like Youtube are 100% free to censor whatever the heck they want without violating the First Amendment.

He’s presented as a lone micro e-celeb/YouTuber who was bullied as a kid and the episode refuses to engage with the fact that when he’s speaking as an employee of Vox (including his calls for censorship) he’s speaking with a major media company funded by massive corporations behind him. That’s a massively significant aspect of the story that needs to actually be incorporated into the story (regardless of what your preferred outcome of the dispute ends up being).

mi-16evil,"The YouTube algorithm is so fascinating to me as a fan of movie essays. On the one hand it's been phenomenal for the format. You've seen fantastic interesting and very in-depth critics like Lindsay Ellis and Every Frame a Painting become extremely successful. On the other hand in the last few years you've also seen this big rise of long video essays about popular films that are really more discussions of alt-right ideals than actual film discussions.

So what can happen is you start by just watching movie reviewers and then it'll recommend a longer video that is fairly neutral politically. But then at some point you're going to watch something about say Star Wars or Marvel and then it will probably recommend something with a more conservative bent. You watch that and then it recommend something more in the alt-right sphere and then at some point it doesn't even recommend a movie review at all. It just recommends alt right videos. So without even realizing it you just slowly got indoctrinated into a particular group. You start by watching a Captain Marvel review and then months or years down the line all you watche are incel videos or alt right videos.

I can see why this is an extremely difficult problem. I don't want them to go back to promoting shorter videos because a lot of content creators who I love would get seriously affected and I really appreciate this golden era of video essays that are finding an audience and are being supported financially. It's hard to say that just because one YouTuber does it with a more conservative angle versus a more liberal angle should be banned. And while I may disagree with someone like say Mauler I don't think he should be kicked off the site unless he's inciting actual violence. But I can't deny watching a Mauler video could potentially lead you down a very dark Youtube rabbit hole.",1562851803,gimlet
randomfunnyword,"I don’t disagree with you but I view things differently. To me, YouTube has every right to react however they want. They can censor speech they can monetize and demonetize however they see fit and they actually have a legal obligation to their stockholders to do so based on profitability. As long as they’re not recognized as a public utility they can do what they want (within the confines of the law). So demobilizing or silencing Crowder is within their right. But it’s also within his right to whine, bitch, moan, and complain on every level to shame them into allowing him to speak on a monetized channel.  

YouTube has no choice but to allow Crowder to speak on some level. Otherwise they risk pissing off conservative members of congress that have the power to eventually reclassify YouTube as public utility. I understand that some people agree with Crowder and some people think he’s an asshole but the last thing YouTube wants is to be responsible for censoring/regulating content. They just want to make money. 

What upsets me is the erosion of the first amendment. You shouldn’t censor hate speech. You offer validity when you censor it. It also doesn’t work. It just makes them louder and gives them the viewpoint that, “Wow, we really hit a nerve by saying that. They don’t want us to say it because IT’S THE TRUTH”. I would rather know you’re an asshole than have YouTube push you underground. What would happen if a small business owner announced he was a nazi? I would now know he’s a nazi and I would no longer shop at his store. Hell, I may even protest outside his store and inform others that he’s a nazi. At least I know, instead of him being a secret nazi. I may have accidentally shopped at his store if he kept it quiet. 

I do think YouTube has confounded the situation by sitting on the fence trying to appease both sides. I think a better option may be running some sort of banner along the sides of content that community members determine to be hateful/hurtful. I don’t agree with Crowder on everything but I do think he has the right to say whatever he wants. YouTube also has the right to react however they see fit. 

I wished that ReplyAll would have stayed away from this one or at least did something more neutral. At one point Carlos mentions a “Socialism is for fags” shirt but it was actually a “Socialism is for figs” shirt. I know Crowder made the shirt to be controversial but Gimlet should report the facts and not further add to either narrative.

I can't stand Crowder, YouTube has been a disaster for a decade, Vox is a joke. This all needs to be understood.

I'm not sure, however, what this episode is adding to the conversation on a whole. By glossing over Carlos's role at a major internet media player (its only mentioned in passing that he works for Vox, which leaves the implication that Crowder is targeting some sort of rando as opposed to engaging in crude media criticism of an established outlet), it instead gives the impression of some sort of alt-right mob just going after a marginalized YouTuber. It's adding nothing valuable to the overall debate about content moderation and internet swarms, and in fact probably lowering the overall discourse on the issue.

Meanwhile, internet journalist Andy Ngo gets physically attacked by Antifa in Portland, and the group cites his videos as fascist behavior and such, assuming they recognize him as a member of the press at all. I highly doubt that this real world example will hit Reply All, which is part of the problem with this overall one-sided discussion. 

This could have been a better episode, but this seems like ideology got in the way of it.

""I had discussed this theory with the producers while we were working on the podcast. I have no idea if this rumor was a reason why they kicked me out. I haven’t gotten any tips or further insight from people who were there, since the podcast aired. Mostly it’s just been people empathizing with me and offering support. And in the process of working on the show, I realized that I am the source of my own closure. They treated me poorly, and that’s sad. But I’m living a great life now… The opinions of a bunch of women I affiliated with more than a decade ago, can’t bring me down anymore.""

If this was the reason, there's no reason why they couldn't discretely tell her without it being in an official capacity. I doubt there was a proper reason maybe just someone with a lot of influence did not like her.

It is mostly done in a joking manner among friends; however, people like Kanye can have their black card revoked for being buddies with Trump. In that instance it is done when we feel like you've betrayed or embarrassed us (us being black people). That guy from Empire (Justin?) had his revoked for all that crazy shit in Chicago. 

It is a bit problematic because there are times when it's done in a more serious manner in order to maintain a stereotypical view of what it means to be black.

As far as dig goes, I think it sounded like it would have more potential if it becomes a social network for dog owners that has dating as an aspect but also allows for friendships and communities to be formed and allows users to find advice, events, product recommendations etc. Idk, it just seems like it needs to be a go to product for dog owners.

Right before I listened to your newest episode, I’d listened to Naval on JRE and I think they’re really interesting in conjunction. 

Naval talked about how the big social media companies, Google, etc signed their death warrants when they began policing content, essentially taking sides. Basically, unless the content is illegal, they should do nothing, he argues. The rest will take care of itself.

But stories like the ones you showcased plainly show the hole in that thinking/system. Even (especially) ones as innocuous as the MySpace picture. It’s a real mess and I have no clue how we get out of it. I think there are solutions, but they’re reserved for societies able to act a lot smarter than we have lately.

rpcrpcrpc,"I think the problem you're going to run into with this line of argument is that you're pulling your criticism of the last few episodes into a big culture war context, at which point there's not really much to be said about the show itself.

Interview driven shows are really tough because you are always dependent on having great guests to interview. Worse still, people have different lists in their heads of who qualifies as a ""great guest"", and so it's likely that you're always alienating some portion of your fanbase. Every show with this format goes through ""hot"" and ""cold"" spells for any given fan. What's worse, the more ""objectively great"" someone would be as a guest, the fewer interviews they can usually do, just because they're generally busy being great and stuff.

For Without Fail, honestly there are some guests where I just felt like the interview itself wasn't that compelling -- e.g. Henry Blodget's episode felt a little empty and I really wish they would've talked more about something he wasn't under brutal NDAs for. That sucked for me especially because it was just *disappointing* more than anything.

But to circle back to my point about the culture war thing: people understand hot and cold spells, and a show not being good for a couple episodes. People usually only get this incensed when they see it as ""pushing an agenda"" or something. To put it another way: you're complaining about a super rich media executives pet project not being consistently excellent quality? For all of 3 episodes? Really? You seem to have a lot of ammunition already in the chamber about this podcast, and that seems... off?",1560791497,gimlet

MightyDillah,"I know this might be an unpopular opinion, because people are just too scared to talk about these kind of things nowadays, but fuck it I'll just say it: I feel like the last 3 or so episodes guests weren't chosen for their accomplishments .. but rather for their diversity. Which is great and all (I am not white) but they're just not interesting compared to previous guests. It seems so forced and theres a stench of white (Jewish? privileged?) guilt almost with every line Alex utters, at least for me. Its borderline pandering, strike that, it is pandering and I just find it awful.

&amp;#x200B;

I might be sensitive to the issue, because I happen to be a ""minority"" or a person of color and I have been discriminated against more than I'd like to remember and to see other people of color being recognized is just amazing and astonishing to me at this point in time. But this is just pandering.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I am sensitive to this particular issue is that there are so many diverse people out there who would fit the profile for this show far better (David Geffen, Toni Morrison, Daymond John,  Jennifer Pritzker, Rea Ann Silva, Serena Williams...etc) The last guests however? no. I feel like they were just shoved into the roster because they play a certain role. Not to minimize their accomplishments but jesus christ, the caliber of people he had on, compared to these guests? seriously? 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe its not fair to compare the last 3 guests to other guests because they all happen to be from the entertainment industry and most of the other guests were from a business background. Yeah, sure and maybe they can be part of another show about diverse people in Hollywood. But it just doesnt change the fact: These guests were not part of this show because of their accomplishments, they were on the show for the sole fact that they were diverse somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

My point: If the previous guests were white, they would not be on this show. There are a slew of amazing diverse people out there, if this show has been able to find amazing/inspiring white people to be on this show before, it shouldn't be that hard to find people who aren't white.",1560771676,gimlet

I mean, YOU don't.. it's your right.

In some ways, he's fortunate that these days, there are more memories readily available than there used to be. It's why parents who lost a child would keep their room the way it was left, or why they'd keep their kid's favorite sweater or teddy bear. We have a digital footprint now.. my kids have HOURS and HOURS of HD quality video of themselves since birth that we can always go back and revisit when they're older.

CozyAmigo,"I think the first thing the startup was claiming to do was what you described but better. His argument was that the process you are a
Describing is incredibly manual at the moment, this company automates the process (so can probably do it at a lower cost, higher margin) it also tracks data on all participants so that it can improve recruitment over time better matching potential users to products so the company gets better feedback. The pitch seems to be similar to using  something like workable over a manual process (lots of time or effort) or external agency (more expensive). 
The second piece that sounds like it will be much bigger seems to be saleforce for user feedback. Managing and sharing the feedback data across multiple sessions and multiple departments",1560069386,gimlet

tinkletwit,"Is anyone else confused about the actual business? If I understood it correctly, businesses like these already exist. I used to be in a database of a firm that would call me up from time to time to participate in a focus group or to review a product on an individual basis. The people at the firm didn't do the interviews themselves, they just arranged for people like me to come in and handled the payment as an intermediary. Then there would be someone from the client who would interact with us. For example, I went once to review a Rosetta Stone product. Another time I went to participate in a mock jury. I really don't get how the business on The Pitch was any different.",1560025917,gimlet

TheHodge,"I've just had the same thought process myself, I've no real issue with them doing one episode in a feed to try and entice people into listening to a new show but the startup feed is replaying the whole season and I'm downloading each episode twice now which whilst i'm sure will be helping gimlet's stats is of no value  for me.",1559912867,gimlet

CozyAmigo,"You can only edit around someone so much and when you listen to the episodes without him they are much more balanced, that tells me that it's him. I don't mind the entrepreneur being challenged but Michael at times comes up with an assumption and doesn't seem to actually be interested in the entrepreneur's answers. At times he seems more interested in winning an argument than actually learning about the company. It's his money and I have no issue if that is how he conducts his pitch meetings but personally it makes the episodes less enjoyable for me",1559912722,gimlet
CozyAmigo,I really like without fail but I don't agree with putting all the eps in the startup feed. Doesn't really make sense. I'm also hoping for a season on the spotify sale and it would be cool to have another season on the tv shows and movies being made from their podcasts,1559911802,gimlet

Baupost,"I think our perception of that falls to the edit more than anything else. Negotiations like this aren't that sexy and Michael is trying to figure out whether it is worth putting serious sums of money into this company. That is a big risk and I typically find his questions the most interesting (far more interesting than Jillian's glad-handing). I agree he took over the episode, but I can't blame anyone in a real-world situation who does that given the ramifications. Who I can blame is editors who aren't able to better balance an episode.",1559828447,gimlet
CozyAmigo,Yeah that's exactly my point. Michael (the investor) was saying that AI can replace those human interviews about a new product but he's wrong for the reasons we've both pointed out and his example was more about taking an existing product (I think he also mentioned a three legged table) comparing it to past data and seeing how well it will sell. AI can do that but it won't replace the entrepreneur's business which was Michael's main and incorrect point. At best AI could be used to improve the process of recruiting testers but not replace them all together. And the company pitched here would actually be the best placed to build that AI because they are collecting all of the data on who the best users to interview are.,1559818081,gimlet
PhAnToM444,"I think that AI can do what the guy asking the question was talking about, the thing is he wasn't asking a question about what this product does.

The example given was what color of table people would want to buy. AI can currently scrape sales data and consumer trends to predict what colors of tables are becoming more popular.

However, this guy's service was talking about companies with entirely new products or product features. AI currently (and will for the foreseeable future) only work when there is data to feed it. When a company is trying to discern whether a new product or feature will be well-received, and moreover which specific parts of it are liked/disliked, AI really can't tell you anything about that until you have some humans teach it where to start.",1559800930,gimlet
robot_redditor,"Only listened to the first episode, but I enjoyed Michael Lewis’s podcast “Against the Rules”",1559782641,gimlet
CozyAmigo,Michael really does try to take over the room. It can be a bit exhausting at times. Especially with his obsession with buzzwords. I thought him trying to take the recruitment revenue completely out of the valuation was ridiculous. His claim that this would all be replace by AI seemed as optimistic as people who say we'll all have self-driving cars in a couple of years. AI can definitely help the process and spot trends but it's nowhere near being able to predict how users will respond to a completely new product. Then after all that he screwed up the follow up. I definitely prefer the episodes without him,1559780360,gimlet
PhAnToM444,"For anyone confused by these terms (people often are):

Pre money is the value of the company before it is invested in. 

Post money is the value of the company after the investment happens.

Because obviously if I give your company $5 million of cash it is not $5 million more valuable than it was yesterday.",1559779324,gimlet
LooselyHeldOpinions,Usually valuations are spoken about in pre-money valuations but dilution happens on a post-money basis. So $5M @ $15M valuation probably means that they got diluted 25% ($5M/$20M),1559776671,gimlet

CozyAmigo,This isn't that much of an issue for me as I'm more of a casual podcast listener but can't podcast apps be set to notify you when there's a new episode? Seems like pretty basic functionality and it would save having to manually. It wouldn't make the shows get dropped any quicker but at least you wouldn't have to think about till you get a notification.,1559759661,gimlet
Jimmy_Mc_Nulty,I like to think that someone made this exact thread after episode 2.,1559746283,gimlet
MrTheorem,"I'm sort of surprised by the conclusion that pink for girls and blue for boys is an American thing. The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_sources_for_pink_and_blue_as_gender_signifiers) has loads of examples and shows that there are substantial references to this in Europe as far back as 1823, originally in The Netherlands but strongly in France and Russia as well. There are comparatively fewer of the pink is for boys, blue for girls, and the earliest is 1889 in Italy and then the rest in the US.

That pink for girls, blue for boys is a French thing is also suggested in this passage from American author Louisa May Alcott's 1869 *Little Women, Part II, Good Wives*:
&gt;""Are they boys? What are you going to name them?""
