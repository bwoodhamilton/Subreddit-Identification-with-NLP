First of all, Papa Jesse, I wanted to give you my sincere thanks for offering such a thorough answer, it’s very enlightening, and very much appreciated.

There’s a lot of details in your response I more-or-less suspected was the case.  

Toronto is totally a second-tier market btw, I have no qualms about that. Sometimes we luck out, sometimes we don’t. I guess I thought at first it was funny that another Canadian city like Vacouver got so much attention, but your explanation of its proximity to other places like Seattle and Portland DO make Vancouver as a destination choice make a lot more sense.  

There’s a lot of nice of nice performance venues in Toronto, but if people are filling big theatres now, I get how that can complicate things a bit. I was at the MBMBaM show in Detroit last year, and that theatre was huge. I guess performing in rooms of that scale can inform a lot the process of deciding what city to perform in.

I see now that there’s a lot of fine logistical aspects that one has to consider when planning a podcast tour, ones that can make a market like Toronto difficult to attend. I’m sad to know that podcast tours might not come through here as often as would be nice, but I get why now that that might be the case, and it makes a lot sense, and knowing all these details you’ve elucidated for us makes things a lot easier.

JesseThorn,"I know we were looking at it for the last JJGo tour date, along with Atlanta and Austin. We ended up going with Austin because the venue options were better and Griffin and Rachel were there. With JJGo we were pretty careful about booking because we both have to take time away from work and I have to take time away from family, leaving my wife with no backup, and frankly our show isn't popular enough for us to profitably play in second-tier markets. (Not a value judgement, I'm solely talking potential-audience-wise.) I was genuinely hoping for Toronto, simply because I've never been and would like to visit, but we couldn't make it work.

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding is that (like Atlanta or LA) Toronto's a bit of a soft market relative to its population, and border/visa issues are a real thing, though they aren't a huge thing. I think you'll find people play Vancouver because it's right next to Seattle and Portland, which are great markets ticket-sales-wise. With the last Hodgman tour, we did fine in Vancouver, but it was one of our smallest shows. We threw it in so we could see Graham and Dave and because it's an easy drive from Seattle, which was definitely on the list. We routinely do better in Portland and Seattle than in LA or even New York.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of weird issues around places where people do and don't come out for stuff - for example Houston and Dallas are huge cities where live shows routinely do worse than they do in like... Portland. There also aren't many friendly venues and promoters. BUT, Austin is a smaller place where people do well, not least because people in Texas will drive from other parts of the state if they're actually really into it. Meanwhile, in LA, people won't even drive from two neighborhoods over. Of course, if you're going to Austin, you have two full days of flying, because it isn't near enough to anything else to string together driving days, as say NYC, Philly, Boston and DC are. We sort of depend on our booking agent to help prioritize and figure this stuff out.  


If you're MBMBaM, they're filling big theaters now, so they can still sell 500-1000 tickets in Salt Lake City or whatever. If we had brought JJGo to SLC, we'd have a hard time selling a hundred, and would lose money on the trip (to say nothing of the days spent away from our jobs).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it's all very tricky, and I know it's a bummer when we don't come to your town. We really do our best, especially those of us who aren't making a ton of money doing it because we're, you know, less famous. Or who have families, etc.",1555046088,maximumfun

WikiTextBot,"**George Tirebiter**

George Tirebiter was the nickname initially given to a dog at the University of Southern California in the 1940s who was the unofficial mascot of the school before becoming the official mascot on October 22, 1947.  The nickname was passed on to George Tirebiter's subsequent successors after the original Tirebiter's death in 1950.  The original Tirebiter was a nationally known figure and beloved canine of the University of Southern California.  He would lead the marching band out at home football games and once even entered in an armored car.

In this episode, the three Ferengis crash land in 1947 Roswell, New Mexico and must fight their instincts to make a profit over surviving this bigoted, selfish, greedy planet. The episode guest-stars Megan Gallagher (who was in the episode with Lionel Luthor), Charles Napier (hell of a combination), Connor O'Farrell (CSI, 21 Jump Street), and James MacDonald (Buffy).

This was a favorite of Armin Shimerman's as it showcased the Ferengi language and more family dynamics, especially between Rom and Nog. 

The lines of dialogue about the atomic bomb were based on Behr's feelings about the power of such a destructive weapon from ""Dr. Strangelove"" to a very acceptable trump card by Ahnuld in ""True Lies.""

We tried to drop a lot of absurdities into the episode to make it clear over time that we hadn't gone completely off our rockers.”

Interestingly, the concept of this cult is similar in the broad strokes to an actual (and incredibly troubling) called the Remnant Fellowship/Weigh Down Ministries. It’s a quasi-Christian group in Nashville that equates spirituality with weight loss.

If this was just a normal not live show, i doubt they would call it a disaster, i think they consider it a disaster because it was live and they weren't getting the best feedback from the audience as possible, so they could feel the energy and know that the audience paid.

Currymango,"""Rejoined"" originally aired on the week of October 30, 1995. Dax meets an ankylosaur who was their spouse several hosts ago, and the memories of their love return even if it is forbidden. The episode was written by Rene Echevarria, who wrote ""the Offspring"" and ""Transfigurations"", and Avery Brooks returns to the director's chair. 

This episode tackles the still-taboo subject of homosexuality on network tv, and execs were actually tricked by the producers when Kahn was written as a man. While the episode features a kiss between Susanna Thompson and Terry Farrell, it was not the first lesbian kiss on tv. David E. Kelley did it twice on LA Law and Picket Fences. 

Headlines this week:

Quebec votes in a referendum to remain part of Canada.

The NJ Devils remain in New Jersey.

A surprising amount of famous deaths including Terry Southern, Rosalind Cash, heads of state.

Including Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by a college student in broad daylight. According to This American Life, a commonly accepted conspiracy theory is that the gunman did not do it.

Spanish Broadcasting System buy WPAT-FM (93.1 FM) for $83.5 Million

The Chicago Bulls win 72 games in one season, and 37 home games on their home turf in the current basketball season.

Boston Celtics lose to the Milwaukee Bucks in their new stadium.

The Portland Trailblazers lose to the Vancouver Grizzlies in their new stadium.

GaustVidroii,"I don't really agree with this read on Bashir (for one thing the character is Indian).  I do think he feels that he is obligated to help the J'H, and overconfident in his ability to do so. But part of the entire ethos of Starfleet is a commitment to service to any and all forms  of life that ask to be helped.    
Moreover, an important part of this episode's story is that the J'H are at least capable of being the moral and ethical equals of Starfleet, in willfully turning from an unnecessarily violent path that has been thrust upon them, without any external guidance. They are certainly the technological peers of Starfleet, if not superiors. There isn't an assumption that other martial aspects of their culture are wrong, similar to how the Klingons are treated. I'd suggest at least one of these had to be true for this to veer into privileged savior territory.    
The ep doesn't suggest ""the oppression is fixed now because Starfleet is here."" It does say ""when someone asks for help, you believe their request is real, and you try your God damned hardest.""  I think your read suggests that the Jem'Haddar are incapable of escaping their oppression while the oppressor class exists, and that is just total outre with the message of Star Trek as a whole.

goldAnanas,"I love the concept of ONRAC but, if I'm being honest, I can't actually listen to the podcast.

In this specific podcast, I got 20 minutes in and they still hadn't said anything of substance about the naturopath course other than a bit of laughing about how the information stressed the importance of drinking water and consuming other micronutrients. 

I get that it must take a lot of time to do these kind of projects and, as a result, they probably don't want everything condensed down into a 10 minute episode. But realistically, you can't decide how long your content should be based on how long it took you to make. Movies that take twice as long to make don't have runtimes that are twice as long.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;She is an introvert who clearly doesn’t want to be a nag. She asks for the minimum after moving away from a home she now misses. She’s lonely, and she wants friends in her new community. The case played out like he has a full week and no time for her, but it really sounded like she was sad that he wouldn’t take a few race nights out to play trivia with her and help her meet new people.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is a JJHO trend of one partner trying to be as thoughtful and undemanding as possible and the other not recognizing it. But unlike the case of snack food - where she tried to balance respect for his collection and her need for space, this is a deeper matter of loneliness.  
&gt;  
&gt;When someone gives up their community for you, they shouldn’t have to nag you to help them get settled. He clearly cares for her, but instead of just promising one night a week for them, he should immediately and actively help her feel at home with him and their community, realizing that they are not currently on equal footing. Maybe it means missing a few races, but ultimately, it’d mean having a happy partner and having more time for his hobbies because she wouldn’t be socially reliant on him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Otherwise, he’ll have all the time in the world because she’ll feel like he’s choosing internet racing over her, and will move back to the home she misses.

Making and maintaining friendships can be difficult, especially in that period between youth and retirement. But it is worth the effort for one's own well-being and the health of the relationship. I've seen so many relationships where one side didn't have friends, didn't bother to maintain friendships once the relationship was serious, and/or had no qualms minimizing their partner's more active social life and circle. Each one suffered from the minimal (missing parties or events), to the superficial (axing the idea of a wedding party because one of the pair no longer had friends to participate), to the internal (one partner feeling like the abandoner or abandoned, losing one's sense of autonomy), to the serious (outside relationships disintegrated, and issues were internalized until they later blew), to the very serious (handling the partner's life upheaval/sickness/trauma without help or support).

It would be one thing if it only happened once or twice, but the first couple minutes she did it about 20 or 30 times.  Then she pronounced Sir Didymus wrong and got the name of the ""Bog of Eternal Stench"" wrong in the plot description.  It made it tough to believe it whenever she claimed to love the movie and it was one of her favorites.

Less annoying, but annoying because of how often she added the word ""The"" to the title of Labyrinth, every time she referred to The Dark Crystal she left off the ""The"", just calling it ""Dark Crystal"".

bomblol,"It would be nice if everyone who doesn't have multiple close friends could just go and make some, but it doesn't work like that. Some people aren't good at making friends - and I would say ""aren't good"" is an understatement. I have lived in Seattle for a little longer than the timeframe he has, and the only reason I have any friends here is because I (in part) convinced two friends to look for jobs here. I don't know whether to attribute it to the mythical Seattle Freeze or to the inherit difficulty of making friends as an adult when you don't have kids, dating, or existing groups of friends to meet more people through. In fact, if it wasn't for the overall tone of the episode and the show in general, some of the comments that were made seemed pretty callous to me.

Also, he himself didn't seem particularly burdened by it. Not everyone, myself included, has the energy for or interest in having a broad variety of social interactions on a daily/weekly basis, and it's not a moral or personal failure when you don't have the same needs as other people. She mentioned that she feels bad to go out with friends if he's at home, but if he is content with chilling by himself at home, how is the burden of that on him? And anyway, they mentioned that he still maintains his friendships with people who live in other places, like a lot of people do in 2019, so I don't think ""not having people to physically meet up with regularly"" and ""not having social connections and interactions"" are the same thing.

About Mindfulness.

&amp;#x200B;

Mindfulness is the psychological process of bringing one's attention to experiences occurring in the present moment,\[1\]\[2\]\[3\] which one can develop through the practice of meditation and through other training.\[2\]\[4\]\[5\] Mindfulness is derived from sati, a significant element of Buddhist traditions,\[6\]\[7\] and based on Zen, Vipassanā, and Tibetan meditation techniques.\[8\]\[9\]\[note 1\] Individuals who have contributed to the popularity of mindfulness in the modern Western context include Thích Nhất Hạnh (1926– ), Herbert Benson (1935– ), Jon Kabat-Zinn (1944– ), and Richard J. Davidson (1951– ).

&amp;#x200B;

This is a excerpt from a ""WikiPedia"" article (source i told you, look it up) 

...there is a lot of writing on it.

what i haven't come across, is much on the idea of ""another s ""Mindfulness"""" 

...about being ""Mindful"" of another entity's ""mindfulness""

&amp;#x200B;

Examples:

&amp;#x200B;

1: sometimes, when I hold the door open, while being mindful of an others situation, i am wanting them to be mindful of mine, in that I am holding this door open  because i could relay  use a thank you right now, it would make me Feel Better, as a person, for trying to be ""Mindful""  ....and on.

2: sometimes, someone shows up at your house, with a pickle ina bag.

...and its exactly what you need, at that moment.

Say you Really love pickles, to the point, you bring them to onether peoples houses, so that next time you visit, they will have pickles you can eat. 

...and then,  when They come to visit You, they bring you a pickle. 

Because they know you enjoy them.   ...and on.

&amp;#x200B;

Mindfulness.

I think the word has been undervalued, and while not misinterpreted, not fully understood.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i am making fires, in my home, to warm my family.  I am trying to do it all correctly, but i understand that there are many ways to light fires, some get out of control, and some completely fail to light. 

i am making fires, in my home, to warm my family, and i am trying to do it methodically, and slowly, ...while still making my own mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

i am making fires, in my home, to warm my family, in hopes that they will pay attention, and then, when they next make fire, maybe it will be easier for them.

Aaberg321,"Absolutely. The poor sod probably was lured in by the same people why initially got to Britt Marie Hermes. Thankfully, she had the guts and integrity to say goodbye to that horseshit, despite having invested time and money in a ""degree"".

From her bio:

&gt;My name is Britt Marie Hermes, and I used to be a naturopathic doctor. I earned my degree at Bastyr University in 2011 and went on to complete a one-year naturopathic “residency” at a private clinic in Seattle. I then moved to Tucson, Arizona where I practiced alongside other alternative health practitioners. I stayed here until I retired from the profession in 2014. I now live in Kiel, Germany.

&gt;I left naturopathy with a bang. In the spring of 2014, I discovered that my boss, also a naturopath, had been importing and injecting a non-FDA approved medication called Cialis to cancer patients. I resigned from his practice and reported him to the Arizona naturopathic medicine board and the state attorney general. During my final meeting with him, my former boss informed me that he knew he was operating in the “grey zone” and that this was common in the naturopathic profession.

&gt;He was right.

&gt;Naturopathy is not what I was led to believe. The profession functions as a system of indoctrination based on discredited ideas about health and medicine, full of pseudoscientific rhetoric and loaded with ineffective and dangerous practices. Naturopaths must be highly scrutinized because they have an on-going history of deceit and exploitation—veiled in good intention.

&gt;Since my departure from the profession, I have been working to understand my former biases surrounding naturopathic medicine and why I was drawn to it. I thought I was highly trained and medically competent, but I could not have been more foolish.

&gt;I now write about the evidence, or lack thereof, of naturopathic methods and the ethical and educational shortcomings of the fledging profession. I contribute to Science-Based Medicine, Forbes, Science 2.0, and KevinMD.

&gt;Currently, I am a PhD student in evolutionary biology at the University of Kiel. I study the interplay between the composition of mammalian microbiota and the genetics of their host species.

Scnd123,"There are 2 kinds of naturopaths.  Naturopathic Doctors that attend naturopathic medical school for 4  years,  pass 2 sets if medical boards, hold naturopathic medical licenses (in licensed states), have DEA numbers, do residencies, accept insurance in some states, etc
As opposed to 
 mail order “UN-Ds” who get mail order education and use the word naturopath.  
Sadly it can be difficult for the consumer to know the difference unless they know there are 2 types of naturopaths.  Naturopathic Doctor’s and naturopaths.
In licensed states, it is illegal for an UN-D to call themselves a naturopath.
I think it is important to have educational opportunities. Like these to help people learn the difference.  
As for Ross and Carrie:  If you plan to attend an accredited naturopathic medical school,  I will see you in 4 years.  You aren’t going to have much time to do any more episodes for a while.
In general, naturopathic Doctors hold the belief there is an underlying cause to someone’s health issue.  Removing that “obstacle to cure” can help a person heal.  Work to find underlying causes as a licensed medical professional while maintaining a doctor level degree in prescriptions, neutraceuticals,  diet,  physical medicine, etc.  
Seems to me helping people heal instead of using prescriptions to cover symptoms is a medical education and philosophy that could improve the current health care system.
At least there could be a benefit in everyone understanding their options so that we all can first try to fix problems and then try to suppress symptoms using treatments starting with less force and going to more force.",1550950489,maximumfun

1 mol of a substance weigh's approximately the atomic mass of the substance.  The atomic mass of Hydrogen is approximately 1, so 1 mol of Hydrogen is approximately 1 gram.  The variations are due to different isotopes and then differences atomic weights due to nuclear physics (nuclear mass defect).  

For a long time Avogadro's number was based on having 1 mol of Carbon-12 be exactly 12 grams.  The new definition taking place in May is to make the number just be a fixed constant to make improvements in measuring C-12 mass not affect the number.  Just make everything be different slightly.

But the joke is this:
The number is to remind you of Avogadro's number.  A chemically inclined person will think:  the answer is going to be Avocado's number and it's a pun!  But, if you cut something that many times, it's going to be a mush, hence guacomole.  The surprise answer is the joke.

Galoptious,"I loved how Britton kept the judge on his toes! It was fun to listen to.

As for allergies... There's no question that Britton is a bit careless about the allergies she's suffering. At the very least, she should find out what meds work for her, and have some on hand to alleviate symptoms -- not just for her own comfort, but because a bad reaction can permanently change the sensitivity a person has, and there are things that can make a reaction turn from uncomfortable to deadly. For example, if you're experiencing minor anaphylaxis and you run, your blood will start pumping more and the reaction could spread further and more dangerously. 

Epipens are not a solution -- they are meant to be administered to give people more time to get to a hospital and receive treatment. And it's hoo-haa to say her boyfriend doesn't need to clean bedding and get rid of hair when she's on his turf.

All that said, it's illogical to state that she should visit an allergist because allergies can change. By the very definition of these comments, her sensitivity can change after finding out what her allergies are. Furthermore, they cannot tell her the full nature of her reaction, and deciphering food allergies in particular is still a work in progress, one that often requires more testing than a casual visit to an allergist. 

The allergist will introduce allergens to your skin and tell you what your skin reacted to, and along with your past experiences, suggest methods of dealing with it. Then it's up to the person to decide.

One could reasonably argue that low-wage workers should be paid more across the board, and prices should be raised (or profit margins narrowed) to accommodate that. I generally agree with that position. I don't believe that relieves me of the responsibility of tipping when socially appropriate.  


My wife worked as a barista. She took the job because she earned minimum wage plus tips. That's what made it an appealing job, and she knew that because she was good at it, she was making a pretty decent wage for her work. You may have noticed that baristas are relatively skilled workers who generally provide high-quality service, even at national chains. That's in large part because they are paid relatively well. If you think that when workers consider apply for or taking that job, they are not presuming that if they are competent they will receive additional compensation in the form of gratuities, you're sorely mistaken.

Dollydaydream4jc,"I felt like Judge JH missed the point of the listener who wrote in about tipping baristas. You tip for service in industries where the servers rely on tips because they're given less than minimum wage by their employers. In the situation of getting a muffin or something from a barista, there is no service involved, and baristas (correct me if I'm wrong) are given a wage at or above minimun (unlike restaurant servers). If you tip a barista for a muffin, it isn't much different from tipping your Walmart cashier. No, I'm not a baby boomer. I'm an avocado-eatin' Millennial. ",1549515873,maximumfun

Clown without Pity- Bart tells a parody of movies like [Child's Play,](https://player.fm/series/pumpkin-spice-podcast-2430766/childs-play-1988) Gremlins, and that episode of the Twilight Zone. Dan Castellaneta pulls double duty as Homer and the Krusty Doll designed to kill him.

King Homer- Grandpa Simpson takes the reins and discusses this remake of the 1933 film.

Dial Z for Zombies- Bart tries to get out of writing a book report and decides to dabble in the dark arts.

There are names that can be near impenetrable by other languages, but there's no excuse for the names easily pronounced (or reasonably close). Why do we so easily accept people's laziness over the smallest bit of effort, and often, no effort at all? I can't count the number of times people have been reluctant to tell me their real name, or real pronunciation. ""People always get it wrong,"" they say. I repeat the one or two basic syllables back, and they are astonished. 

Why do we embrace our Starbucksian mispronouncing ways? 

Names like Siobhan might give us pause, but we can handle saying Chrissy ""Tie""gen or Ariana Grand""ee"". If we decide to immortalize a European name into a town name, and don't simplify the spelling, why confuse matters with the pronunciation?

“Seventy six trombones caught the morning sun,  
With a hundred and ten cornets right behind.  
There were more than a thousand reeds springing up like weeds,  
There were horns of ev'ry shape and kind.  


There were copper bottom tympani in horse platoons,  
Thundering, thundering, all along the way.  
**Double bell euphoniums** and big bassoons,  
Each bassoon having his big fat say.”

grothendieck,"I agree with your points, and I want to add two more points:

1. Christmas has become (over the last century) a very decorative, showy, and month-long holiday. Rosh Hashanah and Passover seem to be (at least from my perspective as an outsider/non-Jewish person) more about private celebrations with family than about expressing to all your joy through ostentatious displays. This trend of putting electric lights on everything is a very recent thing, in the scheme of things.

2. Christmas itself wasn’t always this important in Christendom. Its origins are Pagan (Saturnalia celebrated by the Romans) and because of that, Christmas was actually banned by the Puritans in England and New England in the 17th century. That’s right, the real war on Christmas was by Christians, and clearly they lost, because Christmas has prevailed. 

Anyway, I guess what I’m trying to say is that, yes, even though Chanukah is a minor holiday, that doesn’t mean Christmas should get free reign over our decorations for a month. Also, I would like to lament that Christmas has been made so religious over that last millennium. Why can’t we have a nice holiday about gifts and lights and cookies and booze for everyone to enjoy?

YourMombadil,"I’m a Jewish guy married to a Catholic woman, raising our kids as lapsed Catholics, but with a knowledge of and celebrations from both traditions. Personally I disagreed with the ruling, because I feel like the good Judge did not consider a key fact relevant to the case: the vast discrepancy between the centrality of the celebrations to the respective faiths.

Hanukkah is a very, very minor holiday. You know Arbor Day? It’s like that, but less so. It has been vastly inflated in our society entirely because of its proximity to Christmas, but it’s not Christmas. It’s sort of like tied with Secretaries’ Day (sorry, Administrative Professionsals’ Day) in terms of theological importance. Whereas Christmas is a commemoration of the godhead entering into our plane of existence ostensibly to redeem the world. They are not remotely equivalent except in the calendar. And a ruling predicated on showing kids an equivalence between them is therefore fundamentally flawed.

The plaintiff argues that Christmas decorations make her house not feel like her house. But, she chose to make a house, a home, a life with a Christian (or at least Christmas-observing) partner. In my opinion she is not respecting his traditions, which is still the case despite those traditions being overwhelmingly dominant in our culture. And I admit the defendant does not help his case by bringing up the pagan elements of the holiday - Jews aren’t pagans either, so sorry, but that remains alienating.

In our family, we do a small Hanukkah - with disposable gifts of a few dollars at most; cheap drugstore stuff that just aims to be fun before it inevitably breaks. We keep an electric menorah up all season along with the tree and some (yes, tasteful, non-multicolored) lights. And then the big presents arrive Christmas morn. That seems to accurately reflect the two holidays, to me. And then, significantly, we celebrate Rosh Hashanah and Passover as big family celebrations that reflect their centrality in Jewish culture.

jennifermarmalade,"Hi! I share a lot of your feelings about being Jewish during Christmastime. My mom was the room parent in elementary school who came in with dreidels and latkes. It's an interesting thing for me to think about now. I married a Christmas celebrating person and we have a tree and a few Winter/Christmas decorations in the apartment. I LOVE doing the tree and it felt really novel the first couple years we had it. My mom refused to get a Hanukkah Bush for the same reasons your dad did. We would drive around ""Candy Cane Lane"" to look at the lights, because it's so fun! My mom actually now has one of those popular projection light things that project dreidels and other Hanukkah images on the house. It's weird to go there when that's up because it feels very much like, ""This is what other people do, not us."" But I really love how into it she is!

But as my husband and I talk about having a family one day and what that will look like, I start to wonder if I am going too hard with Christmas and not hard enough with my own family traditions! I have been thinking about that more and more this year, with everything that's \~going on\~ in the U.S. 

Anyway, I really love making this show and working with John and Jesse. This episode in particular was unexpectedly personal to me. I'm glad you felt good about how the verdict went. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. &lt;3",1545327985,maximumfun
ZeGoldMedal,"Wow. I don’t think I realized how much I needed this episode. Haven’t had as visceral a reaction to an episode maybe ever (or maybe the Kung Pao Chicken episode, a similar saga of a well intentioned privilege dude unintentionally asserting their privilege).
I may have teared up a little during the verdict.

I’m a Jewish guy, my dad is very Jewish (or very American reform Jewish), and so is my mom, though she converted after my birth. And this episode just reminded me of so many feelings I used to have about the holiday season that I’ve just forgotten about. Because I think I let a love for the American Christmas take over a little, and an absence of a Jewish community has gotten to me. Christmas wasn’t a thing for me growing up, I always felt a little bit like an outcast at school during December, though I was always brimming with pride when my dad would come to my class to read Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins. 

Christmas has always been a reminder that I’m an “other.” I love it to death, but it always makes me feel like a bit of an outcast. At one point in this episode, Paul mentions that he sees Christmas as a holiday of “welcoming the stranger”, which is true, but it often feels like welcoming the stranger involves erasing the stranger. I’m already welcomed to Christmas, Christmas is fucking everywhere. The war on Christmas? It was won centuries ago. (I don’t even want to get into how much that wat on Christmas narrative makes my blood boil). And every wreath, every manger, is simultaneously a reminder of Christmas joy and a signpost that, as Lizzie said, this is not my home. It’s someone else’s.

I’ve often wondered what would happen during the holidays if I married a goy. My mom is no stranger to the situation, she actually worked as a counselor for interfaith couples for many years. I’ve always wanted a Christmas tree. But my dad never had got us a Hanukkah Bush. He wanted our traditions to be ours, not aping Christmas traditions. Occasionally I went to my maternal grandparents house for Christmas, and I always felt a little less at ease there during the winter, even though it was family (and the only two christmas celebrators were my grandparents) because Christmas just feels like walking into someone else’s house.

This is a bit of reactionary comment, full of stream of conscious and bits and pieces of feelings I felt during this episode. But thanks judge, I feel like you made the right ruling. As a Jew, I never want to be a grinch. I want to celebrate Christmas. But I don’t want to feel like the outcast, I don’t my traditions to be erased. No one wants that during the holidays.",1545326952,maximumfun
FiftyMcNasty,"Boy I wish we could stop maligning Baby It's Cold Outside. I'm fine with the world just collectively stops playing it because of how the lyrics might make people feel now but I think judging a piece of art and ignoring the context it was made in in a bad thing to do.

This song was written in the 1940's; this was a time where it was very socially unacceptable for an unwed couple to spend the night together. The song is a coy back in forth of the woman saying its improper for her to stay and what will all these people think of me and the man giving her the excuses she can use to defender herself against them. At no point does she indicate that *she* wants to leave, in fact she keeps making decisions to stay longer (e.g. ""But maybe just a half a drink more"" and ""But maybe just a cigarette more"")

And then there is the the line everyone likes to harp on ""Say what's in this drink?"". This line is not meant to imply that the drink is drugged or that he is plying her with strong drinks. This is a fairly common saying from around that time for someone doing something that is not within social expectations and using alcohol as an excuse.

I'm not trying to say we should all be listening to this song or that it is even an appropriate song for today. The context that someone views art in is also very important and will affect how they perceive it. All I want is for people to stop making this song into something it isn't. 

edit: So I wrote this all during the ad break not realizing they were going back to talk about the song some more. They got to many of the points I brought up here and I am glad to hear that. I do agree with them that we don't *need* this song and we are fine w/o it in our holiday music rotation. In a modern context yes this would not be OK lyrically and I think it is fine if we just let it slip into obscurity.",1545305953,maximumfun

As far as I see it there are two Christmas's, the Christian Christmas  and the secular Christmas.

If we look at many of the classic trapping of Christmas we can see that it is a blending of many different winter celebrations from cultures around the world. And the Santa mythos that is so deeply linked with Christmas has almost no connection to the Christian story about the birth of their savior. 

I don't think this means that everyone should have to celebrate Christmas. But I do think that Christmas has evolved from a strictly religious holiday to one that is more a secular American holiday about appreciating the ones you care about and sending the year off in style. ",1545220785,maximumfun

WikiTextBot,"**Blue Mustang**

Blue Mustang, known to locals by the nickname Blucifer, is a cast-fiberglass sculpture of a mustang located at Denver International Airport. Colored bright blue, with illuminated glowing red eyes, it is notable both for its striking appearance and for having killed its creator Luis Jiménez when a section of it fell on him at his studio.Blue Mustang was one of the earliest public art commissions for Denver International Airport in 1993. The sculpture was based on the eight-foot-high sculpture Mesteño (Mustang), on display at the University of Oklahoma. Standing at 32 feet (9.8 m) tall and weighing 9,000 pounds (4,100 kg) including its steel armature, Blue Mustang is located in the median of Peña Boulevard.

Grand Nagus Zek, played by Wallace Shawn, returns to Deep Space Nine and holes himself up in Quark's quarters with a new mission, to rewrite the Rules of Acquisition. Our barkeep is rather shocked at this sudden change of personality. Meanwhile, Dr. Julian Bashir is the nominee for a very prestigious medical award, which makes him feel guilty as he is going against doctors who have literally spent their whole lives trying to save people.

The A-Plot was based on Ira Steven Behr's script for an episode of Taxi that was never bought. As Louie (Danny DeVito) is visited by his more depraved uncle Sylvester, and is shocked by the changes.

The B-Plot was based on TNG being nominated for an Emmy and the writers were so sure they were going to win, or at least NYPD Blue was. However, David E. Kelley's Picket Fences won. The show aired on CBS from 1992 to 1996, and was about a small town in Rome, Wisconsin where strange things happen, and yet there's time to talk about important issues of the day.

Rene Auberjonois directed this episode, the first one for him. He will later go on to direct a few more Ferengi-focused episodes.

You aren't actually maintaining a consistent temperature, such as 75 degrees, you're maintaining a temperature differential, such as 10 degrees cooler than outside.  So if the outside temperature drops at night, you are using less energy to cool to the same temperature, because the difference went down.  But for practical purposes, cooling the same house from 80 to 70 costs the same energy as keeping a house at 70 while it is 80 outside or keeping the same house at 90 while it is 100 outside.

It really doesn’t have to kick on much in a well-insulated house to maintain 80 degrees, though. And then it’s pretty easy to get it down to 72 from there. Letting it get up to 95 degrees means it won’t cycle off for a couple hours once I turn it on. ",1544282458,maximumfun

The problem was that we did respond immediately, and then quickly realized dinner was still cooking in the oven.  Sometimes things take longer than you think in the kitchen, so that would sometimes lead to us rushing to the table only to sit there for 5 minutes (often feeling like way more than that).  So it was a constant battle of my mother resenting us for being late, or us resenting her for lying about dinner being ready.

Heavyweights- written by Judd Apatow, and Steven Brill (also directs), the fat camp movie with crazy Ben Stiller. I saw this movie in class for some reason.

Just Cause- Sean Connery is a law professor who is an anti-death penalty activist who must defend death-row inmate Blair Underwood. Laurence Fisburne is the sheriff who forced a confession out of Underwood's character, and the real culprit is Ed Harris. ScarJo also stars.

It’s really doesn’t take a lot of work to figure out that Jesse is very sensitive about not only his own gender and race and it’s relationship to his position of power in Max Fun, but pretty concerned about gender roles and related optics in general.

Poe's law is an adage of Internet culture stating that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken by some readers for a sincere expression of the parodied views. The original statement, by Nathan Poe, read:

Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone won't mistake for the genuine article.

As for the jabs at sous vide, I actually totally agree with the judge - sous vide does take all the romance out of cooking and turns it into a sci-fi procedure, and that IS part of what makes it fun (for me.) however you can’t argue with the results

JesseThorn,"Yeah, we agreed to launch with a transcription service called Gretta that covered ONRAC and Reading Glasses. They're some kind of machine learning startup, their model isn't providing transcripts, it's about using podcasts to get AI to understand talking and how people interact with spoken audio. We were a little nervous about it but decided it was worth a try. Unfortunately, they dropped Reading Glasses, presumably because there was insufficient user interaction, which I think is part of how they learn. Ultimately we're grateful they do this, but don't feel it's reliable in the long- or even medium-term.

We transcribed The Turnaround through a combination of a startup journalism-oriented transcription service and staff time. We found that both sides of that equation were extremely expensive. The service provided a transcript that was filled with mistakes and struggled to identify speakers correctly (even with only two voices), and it took a huge amount of staff time to get it cleaned up. In that case the Columbia Journalism Review did the work of preparing it for publication once the transcript was provided, but that's a pretty significant expense as well.

A lot of companies doing transcription are opening and closing lately, we've been tracking them, looking at whether any of them could do any of this efficiently and affordably. When Bullseye had a transcriptionist, we found that just the process of editing and posting the transcripts he provided was taking like half a day of the producer's time, and at the time that was like 15% of her total Bullseye workload, and it just wasn't sustainable. We are also somewhat hamstrung by the nature of our relationship with our shows, most of which are independently owned and produced; none of this is something we can do unilaterally, and none of it is something we can lay the cost of at the feet of our show creators. Transcripts are a very major expense even for our biggest shows - around a thousand dollars a month per show. That's more than a number of our shows make in total. We are still a very small company that is supported by its audience, not a big VC-backed corporation.

That said, this really is something we have worked on continuously for years. I care very much about accessibility, Bikram cares very much about it, and our hosts and producers care about it. I'm sure as a JJGo listener you've heard about this, but my father is disabled, and he worked for a number of years with his best friend Ed Roberts, who was probably the most significant leader of the independent living movement in the 1970s, 80s and into the 90s. I met Jesse Jackson during his 1988 presidential campaign because my father was writing policy speeches for him regarding independent living. I've also got two kids with audio processing challenges. Accessibility is very personal to me. I've put a lot of time into trying to find a sustainable answer. We just haven't found one yet.

I would love to meet every goal we have as a company, but we have a pretty wide breadth of goals, and we can't meet any of them if the books don't balance. I honestly would just say thank you to those folks like you and ILyr who have shared with us that this is important to them, and ask folks who are calling me a heartless asshole monster on the internet to understand that we are pushing forward on many fronts, and working to run as moral and world-bettering a company as we can, but our resources are what they are, and we have to make hard choices every day.

My biggest hope at the moment in this particular area is that the big tech companies (Amazon, Google and Apple) are all working really hard on voice recognition right now, and Google specifically has promised machine transcripts will be built into their app in the future. That and other platform improvements may change the game here. We will be actively engaged from now until then.

library_cardigan,"Well two Max Fun podcasts (ONRAC &amp; Reading Glasses) seem to do it, so it seems like they'd be a good place to start. I don't think you mean it this way, but to answer a call for accessibility by saying that it's a crazy request is dismissive at best, and cruel at worst.    


Also, blaming costs for accessibility creates a narrative  of blaming people making accessibility claims.  It is also how so many calls for accessibility are handled- and again puts all the responsibility on the person needing accommodations instead of a company/society to do so. And as someone who has hearing loss and has deaf parents I've dealt with dismissive behavior and cruelty all my life. I remember Jesse used to talk about how one of his parents was very active in disability rights, so I would hope that he is sensitive to this kind of language/othering.

It is so wonderful that fans have come together to do this for each other, but as you said, transcription is work, and work deserves compensation.  It would be a huge step forward for a company that wants to be progressive. And it would probably be a PR win. But most importantly, its the right thing to do.

Not all of that needs to be transcibed. Theres the intro, ads etc that could be skipped. So lets say 30 minutes per podcast.

Average talking speed is around 110-150 words per minute, lets say 120 words. 30*38= 1444 minutes of content, time 130 words, makes 18,720 words to transcribe.
