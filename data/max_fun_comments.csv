This woman isn't doing this for her husband, she's doing it purely for herself. She admitted to not wanting to stop even if ordered and openly ignoring her husband's request not to do it and his feelings that it made him upset. This being a live episode, it felt like it was way more joke-y than a normal episode and that they were feeding into her childish behaviors. She taught her husband to loosen up a bit, and that's great, but this isn't part of it and she should stop lying about it. It also felt like a little bit of victim blaming to say he's asking for it because he puts the laundry on the end of a table. I have a hard time believing that she wouldn't do it if it was in the middle of the table, or that she wouldn't mess it up if it was already on the floor.

I wasn't very pleased with the verdict, either. Established law in the court is to be mindful of the work you leave for others, and this isn't in the spirit of that. He does all the laundry (by choice or necessity) and her response is to knock it over while making cat sounds, forcing him to have to clean up a mess and fold the laundry again.

lessmiserables,"For reference:

**Season 1: Balance** The first campaign is Balance, which runs for 69 (nice) episodes using Dungeons and Dragons 5e. They didn't call it Balance right away (that was retroactively added as the game develops) and keep in mind the first arc is most of them literally learning how to play D&amp;D. It can sound a little rough--not bad and it's still pretty fun, but it's striking when you hear how well-produced the later games are.

Note that there were 69 episodes for the season proper, but they did do quite a few live episodes after the end with the same settings/characters. 

In addition, for the Maximum Fun Drive, they did several games over the years called (K)Nights of which there are three episodes, and several other one-off campaigns as a donor bonus, namely Elementary (about Sherlock Holmes) and Fur (about bears. No, really). These are kind of scattered all over the next few seasons. 

After Balance, they ran some experimental campaigns:

**E1: Commitment:** Clint is the DM and it's about a superhero-style organization. They use the FATE system and it runs for four episodes. 

**E2: Amnesty:** See below.

**E3: Dust,** DM'd by Travis. It's a supernatural urban fantasy western mystery (!) using the Powered By The Apocalypse system. Has four episodes.

After the experimental campaigns, they settle on the second one, Amnesty.

**Season 2: Amnesty:** Using the Powered By The Apocolypse system, it's a cryptid hunt, where the strange things going on in Kepler, West Virginia bring the characters together.

Between these seasons, they did the Become The Monster Tour, and did many live one-off shows. Namely:

**Hootenanny**: A Space Opera using the Lasers and Feelings system
**The Ballad of Bigfoot:** A kind-of tie in to Amnesty
**Dadlands**: A group of Dads go on a mission, using a system designed by the brothers
(As yet unreleased): Just Us, recorded in Atlanta. 

**Season 3: Graduation:** This is the current campaign, DM'd by Travis and going back to Dungeons and Dragons 5e.

To answer your question: Start from the beginning. Any of the non-Balance live shows are also good to listen to if you want to break it up, although I can't guarantee there won't be some (usually minor) spoilers.",1579582048,maximumfun

Vercingetorix20,"There are three major campaigns. They are all independent and unrelated, though there are a few running jokes and references that appear multiple times. I don't think it subtracts significantly to only listen to one campaign and not start from the beginning.

Campaign 1 is the Balance campaign, It's a D&amp;D campaigns run by Griffin that ran about 70 episodes divided into 8 Arcs. It's fantastic gaming and of course a great place to start as it's the beginning of the show.

Then there are a series of mini-campaigns as the crew tried to figure out what to do next. There's Commitment, a superhero game run by Clint, Dust, a western mystery run by Travis and Amnesty, a monster hunting game run by Griffin. A good place to start and get a lot of the show's flavor all at once, although some games are weaker than others.

In the end, they decided that Amnesty was the next campaign and it ran for about 36 episodes before ending. It's Monster of the Week, a Powered by the Apocalypse game.

The current campaign is Graduation, a D&amp;D game run by Travis. It started recently so jumping on should be easy.",1579575845,maximumfun

What sales success It found was with older empty nester/replacement hip demo that ok boomers are now aging into.  They liked the gull-wing doors for loading their crteaky old pals into the backseats to get to bridge club.

The element owner community seems to have developed some interesting DIY  customizations. i bet there are some customization ideas for pop-up vendors.

Cargo area is on the smaller side (compared to an Oddysey) but extremely flexible and accessible.

Maybe give it a custom paint job that tips a hat to vintage VWs.  Now nearly a decade absent from the new car market , a well appointed Element would have a vintage charm of its own but relatively up to date in terms of economy, safety and reliability.",1579130767,maximumfun

I whole heartedly believe that my reasoning is sufficiently contained in my OP, but if I may be so bold perhaps you'd let me elaborate. Christmas is used these days as a semi non-denomanational yey Christian celebration. However, many acknowledge it's connection to the solstice.  Opression of non Christian celebrations are widespread, and yet those centred around the Solar Solstice in December were permitted to remain by The Church, independent of hemisphere. I... Cannot... specifically state due to cultural sensitivity.... any of what I specifically know of Christmas being co-opted by ""indigenous"" cultures in an attempt to keep their own, bit I don't think it's much a stretch of the imagination to comprehend such likely happened. Thus, to some, the Summer Christmas is one of the most important festivals merely because it is one of the few things that survive of the original culture.  The tl:dr is, basically ""one can't globally enforce one's own culture on everyone and the expect everyone to follow to the letter"", though I'd humbly submit this is an opinion that has lasted for a while and is arguably known as ""white male supremacist"".

DrColossusOfRhodes,"Dear Dr Jones,

Thank you for your submission to the Journal of Archaeology.  While our reviewers were generally positive about the quality of your findings, there were a number of major concerns about your manuscript.  

Reviewer 1 mentioned that while the properties of this ""Arc of the Covenant"" you describe in your results section are fascinating, it is difficult to accept the veracity of a phenomenon that we can't observe without having our faces melt off.  Reviewer 2 noted that it is hard to imagine an institution that would provide ethical approval to the melting of participants faces, even the faces of Nazis, and the editors of this Journal agree strongly. Reviewer 3 liked the part where you pushed the guy into the propeller blade, but wanted more detail in your methods regarding the snakes; why, exactly, did it have to be snakes? 

While we appreciate your submission and your continued contributions to the field of archaeology, we feel that these concerns are too great to be addressed with revisions and are unable to publish your findings at this time.  We welcome future submissions to The Journal of Archaeology.

It's something that might have breezed over my head if I hadn't read this discussion, because I'm so used to seeing Christmas gently handwaved as a universally applicable, secularized, generic feel-good holiday. But I imagine that might feel like a slap in the face when it's also a focal point of a religion that was used by colonizers to wipe out your culture.

It's rare that a question that's been sticking in my mind is actually addressed on the podcast. I recently got moved to another department at work, a department that both 1) uses slack more and 2) is more diverse than my previous department. It's not really a place where I feel comfortable quite yet being a white dude (who is also plagued with social anxieties) starting the conversation, especially over something that feels like it's small - but often times my manager will say something that requires a response, and the affirmative emoji tends to be the darker skin toned hand. I worry that answering separately with the lighter skin tone (or any other affirmative emoji when the darker skin toned hand is already there) feels intentionally separatist, but clicking that emoji after it's been used feels, as I saw someone else here term it, a little like ""digital blackface."" Seems like if there are other people in the Max Fun office using Slack, like Jesse said, it wouldn't have been too much trouble to ask for their perspective, especially when he admitted not using it himself. Really felt like all three of them were viewing Slack as the same as texting.

 I've been noticing more and more people using the green check mark emoji, which skirts the issue - but doesn't solve the problem addressed in the podcast - where someone is already using the darker skinned emoji or it's a poll.",1578003594,maximumfun

Most people don’t know I’m a person of color until it comes up in conversation.

I often don’t know what skin tone to use for emojis on slack, or the dreaded memoji on iOS. I often worry folks will get the wrong idea if I use a slightly-tan skin tone, but the white skin tone doesn’t feel very true to my complexion or my heritage.

If you just click the existing response emoji, it becomes [✋🏿 7], but if you add your own separate emoji (several additional clicks), it becomes: [✋🏿 6] [✋🏼 1].

If someone is asking about specific dress codes, like what to wear for their job or for a wedding or how to dress for a court appearance, a lot of folks just tell people the standard rules. Then another group of folks come in and start saying how the person should go with what they like, or that it doesn't matter, or some other advice about not caring for the rules. 

I think the second group is doing a disservice to the question asker, because there are many times and places where you are not being judged by your fashion sense but by how well you fit within the norms. 

What do you do when you get asked these questions? Do you just list off a bunch of standards? I talk to younger guys going into my field of consulting, and they look at me like I have two heads when I tell them to just get two pairs of Allen Edmonds and not think about it again.

We had a rule in my house when it came to sweets. My mom, who is 5'2"" and 100 pounds if she is carrying an 80 pound bag of potatoes, barely ate anything, but she always had to have something sweet. If she wanted a cookie or piece of licorice, it had better be there when she went looking for it. My dad, my brother and myself however, could vacuum through a family sized bag of cookies before you could blink.

So, my mom made the rule: you can eat as much as you want, but you had better leave at least one for mom. And we did. Sure, there would be 10 different bags of sweets, each with 1 item left in them, but guaranteed mom got what she wanted while the rest of us had to live with our gluttony.

Seems to me, this could be applied with the chicken tacos. Always set aside one portion for mom. That is hers and is off limits. Everything else is fair game.

Alternatively, mom could make a taco meal, portion them out, and freeze them. And those would only be hers. That way, if she wanted tacos, she would always have them on hand.",1576223601,maximumfun

A major reason the wife didn’t like her husband eating leftovers out of order was because that meant he always ate the good leftovers while she was stuck with the mediocre ones due to what order she wanted to eat things in. 
This perhaps could be solved with the calling of dibs on a share of the good leftovers rather than insisting her husband eat anything in particular. He can eat what he wants but hands off her half of the tacos. Just because she wants to eat them later doesn’t mean he can take them. If he wants to eat his good leftovers first and then stare down an even older Tupperware of rice and beans then that’s his call.",1576183785,maximumfun

Just give each foot a good wipe with the towel before putting each foot on the bath mat, and you're all set. At most, your bath mat might have two slightly damp spots right next to the shower.  


If you just step out of the shower without attempting to (partially) dry your feet, then you end up with multiple wet spots.

Theapproximations,"Since you mentioned accessibility as a priority, I gave the front page a quick review for the sort of things that automated tools can potentially miss. This was a quick review and just the front page so there's likely more a11y issues to address, but just this may be all that's needed to spot the rest on your own.

In the header area, there are several places where the focus ring has very little contrast with the background (with Chrome's default focus ring colors, at least) , with the donate/our podcasts/what we do buttons it's almost impossible to see as someone who doesn't require much contrast for something to be visible. Just navigate the page with the tab key to see what I'm talking about. [https://www.deque.com/blog/give-site-focus-tips-designing-usable-focus-indicators/](https://www.deque.com/blog/give-site-focus-tips-designing-usable-focus-indicators/) . I'd recommend overriding the default focus ring color to something that is very unlikely to appear elsewhere on the site. This will address the contrast issue AND remove the uncertainty of browsers choosing different focus ring colors.

The menu links in the header do not have sufficient contrast to be accessible (Podcasts, Latest, About, etc.) `#FFFFFF` foreground on `#02B0C2` background (that's the beginning of the gradient so it varies a bit), is a contrast of 2.62:1 which doesn't meet any WCAG standard. [You can check accessible contrasts here](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

On the front page, when tabbing through the podcast listings, there are two tabstops for each podcast because the image and the podcast title have separate links. This causes two tab-navigation problems -- there's two tabstops for the same link, and the first (the image) does not provide a focus outline. This can be solved by either wrapping the entire card in a single link, or adding a `tabindex=""-1""` attribute to the image link. [more](https://bitsofco.de/how-and-when-to-use-the-tabindex-attribute/)

In the same podcast listing on the front page, if the ""Load More"" button is triggered, there is no screenreader announcement to alert the user that something is loading or that new content has been added to the page. Content that is added to the page after initial load needs to make itself known to screenreaders via [ARIA live regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions)

Reading through the comments (including some from one of the apparent litigants) it looks like this was a case of the respondent in the case not having any real idea of what show he was on and assuming that ripping on each other for the amusement of others was the name of the game. JJH responded appropriately under the assumption the feelings aired were sincere. 

It’s completely understandable that something like this happened. I remember previously becoming intensely annoyed with two young sisters on the show who quickly lost interest in their story about arguing over a sweater or something and basically just admitted they made it up so they could plug their dogs Instagram account.

I wasn’t proud of how mad I was at some dumb kids and I’m not proud of how icky I felt over these two dudes play fighting over tomatoes. It’s a comedy show. Stuff happens. And there’s no reason I should really care. And yet here I am on the internet. God help me I’m only human, and humanity is apparently capable of being mad at strangers arguing about tomatoes and arm hair. It’s been a weird day. 

Ultimately it isn’t a big deal but it might be nice to do some kind of follow up to clarify and smooth things over.

snoozery,"I recreated a Reddit account to comment to this thread.  That's how much I needed to ask this question:

WHO IS THE LANDLORD?!  These guys went to law school so I'm surprised they're not worried about liability in case the tomato containers fall off the roof and hurt people or damage property.  Sam and Mike try to make this case about ""happiness"" and ""excitement"" for one another, but there are bigger stakes here.

1. Is Sam the landlord?  He keeps referring to the roof as his and his wife's.  If that's the case, he's a generous landlord who lets his tenant-friends work on their hobby on his roof that may or may not cause damage to his property.  If Sam is concerned about people getting too near the edge the roof, he should build a short fence.  Or don't allow people on to the roof.  Did Sam and Mike draw up a proper lease?  In any case, Sam doesn't have to let Mike in to his apartment to access the roof!
2. Is a third party the landlord?  Did Sam and Mike clear this project with the landlord?  Probably not.  How does the landlord feel about his tenants going up to the roof all the time with the possibility of damaging his property?  Either way, Sam doesn't have to let Mike in to his apartment!
3. Is Mike the landlord.  Pretty sure he isn't, but if he is and he and Sam drew up a proper lease, Sam doesn't have to let Mike in bc a tomato garden is not an emergency the landlord needs to tend to.

Also, 99.99% of NYC brownstones have a patch of a backyard.  Grow the tomatoes there, Mike!  As the first floor tenant, you can tend to the tomatoes as much as you want without invading Sam's and his family's privacy.  Also, you don't have to haul dirt, water and equipment up to the roof.  Not enough sun in the backyard?  Find another project.

Sam is 100% correct for being upset and fed up, even if he wasn't a new parent.  If anything, Sam should have brought Mike to court.  However, because Sam's delivery of his defense was so whiny and awful to listen to, no one won this case and everyone is annoyed.",1575575403,maximumfun
NPC12,"I think the general consensus deeply mischaracterizes this case. People seem to think that these two hate each other when they cleary do not. In fact, these two are much more alike than different. 

They BOTH delight in temporary discomfort of their loved ones. One is obvious and physical, while the other is emotional. Sam's tirades had the elegance that can only come with a lot of forethought. Like, a LOT. My theory is that Sam, knowing how badly Mike wanted to be on JJHO, approached this podcast with the intent on just leveling Mike from the get-go. It takes a weirdly competitive person to find the fun in bringing a gun to a rock-paper-scissors match, but you also have to be really close with the person you're dunking so hard on. The problem arose when Sam did TOO good of a job and it left people with a bad taste in their mouth. This was play-fighting taken too far, to where it looked more like real fighting than play.

TacosGetMeThrough,"I think Judge Hodgeman hit the nail on the head with his rant. I don't know how the show is vetted but I get the feeling with this episode that they go in mostly blind considering how it took a more serious turn. I think usually considering the light hearted nature that is ok typically with less vetting.

The problem with this situation is a deeper life lesson. You think moving in with your best friend will be the time of your life, but with wisdom that can likely only be earned with experience, it is almost never a good idea. I just abuse against it with two friends who are now having the same issues. 

I feel for the guy who has the baby but I don't think going on a public podcast is a time to air ALL personal grievances. And to me it is apparent he is fed up with the whole living situation. 

Although the guy who brought the suit I don't quite get what he was asking for as it seems his friend had gone on the roof before? So I feel he was just trying to get on the show for something or just trying to get his old friendship back.

It felt like there was something else, something really unsettling bubbling around beneath the surface of this and the two of them were using the podcast as a mechanism of dealing with that diagonally. It almost felt like Sam had some form of unresolved resentment toward Mike and this was his way of getting it out of the open.

The whole thing about Mike's projects and grievances and pick a card issues was fairly mean-spirited. I also have to say, he really did not get a chance to defend himself. whereas his so-called friend got to go on a 10-minute rant about how awful everything is, he literally did not get more than a few minutes of speaking time to present anything.

To wish to be left alone is no bad thing.

This is not to say Mike is a bad person, but clearly his type of extrovertism and attention seeking rubs Sam up the wrong way. They're a bad match. Life's just like that sometimes.

Overall it was a silly case - no one should be compelled to observe the progress of another's hobby.

Also I think it was Sam asking Mike to play cards properly, not the other way round. Mike didn't get to add extra requests as he already set out his argument in his filling.",1575529497,maximumfun
kingfiasco,"uh, whoa.",1575528647,maximumfun
UffishWerf,"I came to the subreddit (rare for me) to see if it was just me, or if other people thought so, too. 

If you're here reading comments, you can read my whole processing-by-writing comment if you want, but I've also put a TL;DR at the end. 

Sam's repeated complaints about and jibes at Mike for *Mike's* constant complaining were dramatic irony at best, and his insistence that he just wants Mike to be happy felt like a token concession thrown in to appear less vindictive. People who want their friends to be happy don't mock those friends when they say they don't feel like they've had a chance to make their case. (Which seemed justified! Most of Mike's talking time was spent answering questions about what other cases he'd submitted and explaining his irrelevant relationship with his brother, and his explanation that he felt like Sam was enjoying seeing Mike squirm deserved more credence, too, judging from the fact that 2/3 of Sam's argument was ""Mike's a complainer and demander and shouldn't be indulged."" I admit the ""it's a hassle to get to the roof"" and ""I don't have the time, energy, or interest for this now"" third of the argument was compelling.)

That said, I probably AM a little biased in favor of Mike because I also am a person who needs more validation than most (please see this novel of a comment for confirmation), but I absolutely agree that Sam shouldn't be forced to make excursions or pretend to care about the plants' progress. If it isn't fun for everyone, it isn't fun for anyone. But Mike's real crimes were not only non-malicious, they were byproducts of his friendliness: ""too eager to share a thing he loves with others"" and ""indulges in juvenile games with his brother and possibly other friends, and at least once invited/encouraged Sam to play, too."" Sam was scolded for having a lot to say and launching straight into his very-prepared statements without the apologies that rooster-pecked wives of Husbands with Systems generally offer, but his real crime of publicly mocking Mike's enthusiasm and Mike's games *unrelated to gardening and his relationship with Sam* was not only not given consideration, it was heatedly refuted when Mike brought it up. Mike's (equally-irrelevant) request that Sam not complain when he experiences a normal setback in the card games he DOES consent to play was rejected out of hand. Even taking my bias into account, the justice felt unevenly applied. 

So I suspect Mr. Hodgeman of being a little biased too, since his strong feelings against even playful violence and his love of alone time/being an only child make him exactly the sort of person who would be most horrified by a clingy person who enjoys slapping/punching games. I've also wanted to set clear, firm boundaries for people who seemed too desperate for my approval or who were so enraptured by my (very minor, long-past) internet persona that they violated my expectation of privacy so others didn't do the same, so I can at least appreciate the instinct of berating a person who tried to take my picture without my knowledge or consent. And while the same past-small-internet-fame tells me it's probably clear from *inside* of JJHO that multiple submissions are unnecessary and red-flaggy, from the outside, I can see how Mike would think they're okay, and maybe even appreciated. I hear the many-times-an-episode call for new submissions (one of which happened RIGHT AFTER the judge complained that Mike filed too many cases, hashtag always be plugging) and feel like maybe there is a shortage of submitted disputes and sending one or more in would be a service. Obviously, I was wrong, which is great in my case because I hate the sound of my own recorded voice and would not have been able to hide my distress if I had been the target of those accusations from a close friend and a long-admired stranger.

Anyway, bias is human and unavoidable, so I could be misreading things due to my own, but even if the judge was the one misreading, this ruling is not the end of the world, especially if Mike wasn't hurt by it.

TL;DR -- In case Mike WAS hurt by the ruling and arguments, and in case he sees this: please know enthusiasm and minor game-based consensual violence (just like minor game-based disputes,  which I'd be less into) don't make you a bad person. In fact, some people actively like those qualities in their friends. As proof of that claim, *I* like those things in my friends when our interests line up (though when I have spoons for it, I also try to acknowledge and validate even the interests that don't, and have found it lonely when the other party mocks me or clearly tunes out instead of doing the same) and the violence is among siblings or pseudosiblings who seem to agree on the ground rules: no actual pain caused, usually initiated as an acceptance of the other's silliness or as a request for reassurance that mine is accepted, too.",1575527807,maximumfun

boss1000,"Here's my comment on their Facebook page post:

&gt;This is a great episode that I really enjoyed, despite the one section that everyone in these comment sections is zeroing in on. I want to zoom out a bit and offer a slightly broader take. I want to explore why it stung for a lot of people, and what I observe.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I think Ross &amp; Carrie represent a lot of folks who don't feel especially visible. Critical thinkers, freethinkers, skeptics, atheists, agnostics, secular people, and all the other labels... We're not really appreciated too much in the societies we often find ourselves in. ONRAC, however, is a fun space where these ideas are normal and accepted.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;So when a guest who is expected to be on the side of reason, evidence, and science lets loose a massive misunderstanding of nonreligious people and promotes a falsehood that is so common that it's a recurring joke for the hosts on the ratings section (""Where 1 is something super scientific, like, say, evolution by natural selection?""), that hurts!  
  
&gt;  
&gt;It's the situation that's disappointing, to me, though, not the hosts. They made the right move to keep going, stay on target, and choose selectively what to question. This wasn't what the interview was for, after all. So I commend Ross &amp; Carrie for that.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I also would like to observe that the tone of the responses here has been pretty thoughtful, which I appreciate. ONRAC has generated a lot of trust in its audience (including me), and this reaction is a demonstration of that after a strange curveball.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't know if it will ever be addressed on the show, but if it helps, just know that I see you, frustrated ONRAC comment reader, and others feel the same way.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;\---  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Some details on his claims:  
  
&gt;  
&gt;His mention of the metal turning into a Coke can is like straight out of a Ray Comfort chick tract that I received a few years ago (and which he's talked about plenty). I'm guessing he's taken in something from Comfort's oeuvre.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The core thought he's exploring is ""irreducible complexity"", if you're interested in diving in more to what that is and why it's not logically sound. It's an ""argument from ignorance"". In essence: just because you can't imagine how a thing happened doesn't mean it's impossible, nor that the way you DO imagine it is necessarily the right answer.  
  
&gt;

Dude, that’s not how that works. That’s not how that works at all. 

You start with a sensitive patch of skin (obviously attached to nerves like all other skin in your body) that can detect (on some level) the presence of light (and the possibly damaging radiation that comes with it). Fast forward, that patch becomes a pit so the creature has some sense of the direction that light is coming from. Important patch of skin starts getting more robust nerves.

Brian George makes his only appearance as Richard Bashir, speaking in a working man's accent to contrast with Siddig's use of RP. Though he is best known as playing Babu on Seinfeld, he is actually of Baghdadi-Jewish parentage and born in Jerusalem, father born in Lebanon and mother born in India. 

Fadwa El Guindi makes her only appearance as Amsha Bashir, and this is her only acting credit on film. El Guindi is a retired professor of Anthropology at UCLA but she is more famous for her work advocating for Arab-Americans and culture. She wrote and directed a community play, but her lead actress dropped out, so she had to fill in during the performance. A casting agent was sitting in the audience that day, and so she got the role as [Bashir's mother.](http://web.archive.org/web/20020304185445/http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~elguindi/Amsha.htm)

The episode originally aired the week of February 24, 1997.

pifpog,"  As others have stated, the Court rightfully makes the determination that Martin Crane is a member of the so-called Cheers-verse. He encounters multiple members of the Cheers cast over the years and at one point is poised to enter the bar itself. The one appearance of the esteemed John Mahoney as a different character on Cheers should be disregarded under the British TV Doppelganger rule (patent pending). Certainly one could imagine Marty Crane drinking a beer with Norm without any breaking of canon or even any significant ret-conning.

However, as recounted by the litigants the actual question at hand on the day in question was which “Cheers” character would each be. The litigants are very clear to separate Cheers from Frasier – the plaintiff specifically notes she has seen all of one series and an undefined but implied limited number of the later series. Even the expert witness notes she has seen every episode of Frasier but only a select few of Cheers. This differentiation strongly suggest that the shows are inherently different and unique, that connective character tissue alone does not make the shows interchangeable.

This ruling as it currently stands opens the way to chaos. Charles Gunn could now be the Buffy character with whom someone most identifies with because of the number of Sunnydale residents he knows. Florence Johnston, the wisecracking housekeeper in the Jefferson, could be someone’s favorite All in the Family character. The winner of a Star Trek The Next Generation Cosplay event could be Julian Bashir, based on his association with Worf and Chief O’Brien and the fact that he *could* walk the halls of the Enterprise. 

On the day in question the litigants sat in a bar where they were regulars, surrounded by interesting people – a setting that practically demands you invite comparison with a regular on Cheers. If they had been sitting in the balcony of an opera house or sipping lattes in coffeehouse and the plaintiff had said “You know, I feel like Norm right now” there can be no doubt the Court would have viewed this case differently. The Judge should have listened to his own bailiff, who rightfully pointed out that the two shows are tonally and cultural dissimilar and that difference should have been respected.",1573824611,maximumfun

WatermelonFreezie,"When it comes to which of the litigants was being pedantic and following arbitrary rules, and which one was trying to honour the spirit of the discussion, the judge had it completely backwards. And - if I may be so bold - the crux he settled on was a red herring. This is not about the rules of the question, or how they were bent.

The question was not ""Which character are you **in the set of shows that take place in the same fictional universe as Cheers?""** It was ""Which **Cheers** character are you?"" Whether you take that to mean Cheers the bar or Cheers the television series, it is irrelevant because Martin Crane was in neither. And this isn't just technical pedantry - in the context of ""We are like members of this close-knit fictional group"", Emily is choosing a member outside the group/setting and thus intentionally distancing herself from it. This is what Aaron was getting at - her answer probably made him feel like they weren't that close, and trying to get her to follow the rules was the only way he knew to address that.

And honestly, I don't think it's a creative answer, I think it's lazy. ""Paul"" is a creative answer. ""Frasier's dad"" would even be a creative answer, if you were a researcher who felt alienated from their child. But Emily apparently finds the idea of relating to *any* of the Cheers characters so difficult that she would rather find one from a different show. At that point why bother limiting it to Cheers spinoffs? Cheers is in the Tommy Westphall universe. You now have innumerable characters to choose from, which are technically in the same universe! But we all know deep down that was not the point of the question.

WikiTextBot,"**He Died with a Felafel in His Hand**

He Died with a Felafel in His Hand is a purportedly non-fiction autobiographical novel by Australian author John Birmingham about his experiences as a share housing tenant, first published in 1994 by The Yellow Press (ISBN 1-875989-21-8). The story consists of a collection of colourful anecdotes about living in share houses in Brisbane and other cities in Australia with variously dubious housemates. The title refers to a deceased heroin addict found in one such house. The book was subsequently adapted into the longest running  stage play in Australian history and, in 2001, was made into a film by Richard Lowenstein, starring Noah Taylor, Emily Hamilton and Sophie Lee.

Alan Moore was like ""Wait - if superheroes were real, we probably wouldn't be reading superhero comics. Those would die out quick - what would replace them?"" And then just decided it'd be pirates because Alan Moore or Dave Gibbons apparently lowkey loves pirates or something. Also, I believe it's supposed to parallel the main characters (especially Ozymandias) - and I don't know, I kinda dig the way the real life events (in story) are told in parallel with these pulp fiction comic book stories.....I'll admit to finding the Black Freighter boring the first few times I read this comic, finding a lot more appreciation for it, but a lot of that has to do with how my own fascination with comic book history has grown since the last time I've read this.

Also, might as well stay on brand here and say, dammit, Sunny D, season 3 of Daredevil is a return to form and just as good as season 1 (even though I like season 2, it's definitely not as good).

Honestly, I really like all of them. You can tell they put so much heart into making these, and even if it's for training at a crummy fast-food job, at least these weren't boring and in fact entertaining.

I like the [Chili video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=32&amp;v=eOvHZDGK-kY&amp;feature=emb_title) a lot, because it has this cool 80s dance funk beat. I also have fond memories of eating Wendy's chili from the chili, salad, and potato bar that doesn't even exist any more. But they do still serve this kind of chili (these days I stay the hell away from this kind of burgers and fries fast-food, at least the national, corporate chain version--but I'd still down a frosty if someone offered me a free one.).

Not sure if you've had a chance to actually read my blog entry, but it's fairly short and goes more into why and how these videos are so good. And in a kind of tongue in cheek, funny sort of way.

Thanks for your interest. And here's the link to the [Blockbuster training videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc_yHON1oiQ) I mentioned that somehow crawled out of the 9th circle of Hell and into a warm pocket of 90s nostalgia. Really, these represent a brutal kind of customer service, and I would've been VERY uncomfortable doing some of the things these people were trained to do. The creepy, omnipresent man from the in-store TV displays doesn't help either.

Enjoy! There's definitely a huge rabbit hole of these kinds of training videos you can enjoy. If you're a fan of gore, look for some construction and manufacturing safety videos. You won't be disappointed, and I doubt you can get through one without at least wincing once ;-)",1573574104,maximumfun

The reason there's none of that struggling of his morals against the reality of America is because America is completely whitewashed in this movie, e.g. the completely integrated team he fights with. That could have been much more interesting and made use of his position as an American icon in the movie.

Ultimately I don't think you need a whole movie to establish the Captain America character (he's a pretty simple character) so it seems pretty fair to be critical of this movie for not really having an arc. Why not just start where his arc actually does? You could have had a five minute flashback at the start of the next movie and you'd get everything about his character that this movie tells you.",1573223888,maximumfun

Fast forward to modern day and now he has to struggle with his motivations. Do I represent America/shield? Or do I represent what is right? The world isn’t black and white, nazi vs freedom anymore, and that’s where captain America shines.

I just like the movies though, even if some consider them “theme parks”.

They give me a momentary escape from how crappy the world can be, and in the world of Marvel, there are good guys and bad guys, and more often then not, the good guy wins. If that desire for an occasional escape makes me childish, so be it I guess.

As someone who has been both married and divorced, I find it so irksome to the point of obnoxious how many people (typically women) obsess so much over the wedding, and specifically about the need for it to be a grand spectacle in which they are the focus. As Jesse pointed out, at the end of the day it's a public celebration of your union, not a coming out party for one person. The mentality of ""I need to be the focus"" not only diminishes the importance of person they're getting married to, but also detracts from the whole purpose of the wedding: the beginning of your marriage. So many people focus so much on the wedding that the marriage itself seems almost like an afterthought. There's also a huge wedding industrial complex that feeds this belief, as well as the idea that a wedding isn't' complete without the right color pallet and number of hay-bails. Plus, so much of these things evoke bride-as-commodity traditions, which is gross. Focus on the celebration of your relationship in the presence of your closest friends and families. /end of rant.

MikeBackAtYou,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",1572887958,maximumfun

I arrived in Phnom Penh in about 2004 to develop a chemistry and genetics course at a small university.  The man who met me upon my arrival to the city was a a professor at the school I was teaching at.  One of his tasks for meeting me was to help show me around and get me set up with all the necessary documentation.  I needed to pick up a special Visa from a large government building in the heart of the city.  In order to get to that building, I needed to cross what, in the West, would have been a six lane street.  However, this road was absolutely filled with at least a dozen layers of loud motos, bikes and cars quite literally going in every direction.  To an outsider who grew up in suburban Ontario, it was utter traffic chaos. There was no crosswalk and frankly, I could see no safe way to get across.  I noted this danger and panic to my guide. He simply stepped to the curb and faced me (thus putting his back to the traffic).  He said in a calm voice, ""Be a rock in water"" and walked backwards into the traffic!  But lo and behold, the vehicles simply flowed around him as if protected by an invisible traffic force field.  He made it halfway across and yelled ""just don't stop moving when you cross"", turned around with his hands in his pockets and walked the rest of the way.  I made it across that day but I've never been the same since.

Although even someone like Dick Dale who's known best for that instrumental surf style still had a few songs with vocals (ex King of the Surf Guitar &amp; Mr. Peppermint Man) so that's a bit contradictory.

As a broke grad student, I once accidentally backed too far during an awkward parallel parking attempt in a borrowed car that was bigger than what I was used to. I left a note while internally panicking how I would cover the costs. The car owner, a visiting administrator from another university, noted that I was a grad student (he must have googled my name) and split the repair costs 50/50.

During a time in my life when I literally pawned jewelry to make ends meet until I got into a better financial position, that gesture was huge and reinforced not just my own determination to do right but also my trust in others in a way that no reworked Butterfingers or French bread bouquet could have.",1571277043,maximumfun

If you mean ""marginalized groups have concerned about what the majority thinks"" then I agree--that is something that can and should be addressed disproportionate to their size, since there are issues that can easily be overlooked and/or handwaved away.

If you mean ""smaller groups have less power,"" well, yeah. They're smaller and shouldn't get more of a say than anyone else when it comes to consensus.",1570889404,maximumfun

I can't think of many, short of people like Roseanne Barr, who have faced serious consequences for offensive material. Sure someone like Dave Chappelle might trend on twitter for a day and lose a few fans (myself included) for some of his material, but his career is just fine.

I think cancer culture is perceived as a terrible threat because the more people voice their opinion on something, the more it seems loud and threatening to hear. But it's not like each person is thinking ""Let's ruin this person."" They're thinking ""I didn't like this joke, and I'm going to say as much.""

Also when you mention society coming to a collective decision on matters, you're talking about a scenario where smaller groups have less power to express legitimate concerns.",1570888745,maximumfun
lessmiserables,"I get (and agree) with his point, but I think the issue is the fact that people have different thresholds for what is considered ""mean"" and that there *is* a line where you have to accept it.

There is a spectrum--making fun of the LGBTQ+ community on one end, and making fun of airline food on the other (someone, somewhere, worked hard that food!). In between there is a line that we don't want to cross, but it's not on one end or the other.

The problem (as I see it) is that in today's cancel culture, it only takes an extremely small but vocal group to shut down that line, pushing it farther and father to one extreme. We no longer operate on consensus--we don't, as a society, decide that that line is somewhere in the middle. There's always going to be some dissonance, and there's a difference between ""That's not a cool thing we should support"" and ""That's a pretty minor if mildly offensive joke that, all in all, isn't that bad."" Everything is 0 or 10. 

We allow a small group of people in social media and clickbait articles to declare something a 10, and then the media, smelling blood, will destroy that person. People who don't agree are ostracized, so a lot of people just stay quiet--and that's not what we want. It's not consensus, because ""Comedian Offends Some People"" is, at this point, tantamount to ""Comedian's career is over"" even if said statement wasn't that bad and blown out of proportion. 

In the article, Maron says:
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line is no one is saying you can’t say things or do things. It’s just that it’s going to be received a certain way by certain people and you’re gonna have to shoulder that

which I feel is untrue--you can't ""shoulder"" it, because in today's culture you're immediately declared toxic. Comedy can't evolve if people can't take chances, and inherently, taking a chance means somethings things go wrong. And right now, we don't accept a ""wrong"" outcome as being part of the process, we make it suicide. 

Comedy doesn't *have* to be provocative or push the envelope, which is usually the excuse garbage comedians make to say shitty things. But there *is* an element of truth to it--have y'all seen Eddie Murphy's *Delirious*, one of the most critically-acclaimed standups in history? Holy shit, just watch the first ten minutes of it without your head exploding.  And yet it was important to push taboo subjects, see where that line is, pull back if necessary (which Murphy eventually did), and be part of the process. But that means that people are going to dance and even jump over that line while we figure it out, unless you want all your comedy to be what-are-the-things-on-the-ends-of-shoelaces-called variety. 

I know this is a sensitive subject for a lot of people, and I don't want any of this to be an excuse for shitty behavior. But I fear that a lot of people can't critically examine a situation for fear of getting lumped in on the wrong side of things and so no longer contribute, and if we can't have a dialogue we risk boxing people into bubbles that just make things worse.",1570887886,maximumfun

Why on earth would Doug and his brothers remove what makes the cookies even more interesting to their family history? She's their patron saint of returned cookies. She does not have to be given credit for the recipe, which she did not make, but she should be celebrated for the massive win she pulled off as a new member of the family. 

That is the stuff of family legend, and Doug needs to ask himself why he is so insistent on not celebrating it. Why he didn't want to boast how much his wife kicked butt bringing those cookies and making them all so happy. Why he didn't feel that she deserved credit for the reintroduction. Why, even post-judgment, all he could think about was changing the recipe so he could give it a new name himself.

He began to look a little uncomfortable, and I suspected that he was nervous about being accosted by fans. I suggested that now was a really good time to go to the bathroom if he happened to have the need... and he obliged.

As he left I felt good about myself, knowing that he probably really appreciated just being treated like a normal customer.

Steve said ""thanks but no photos"" and scurried off to his car, or his chauffeur, or whatever he had arrived in.

El_Seven,"So for a good chunk of my career I was one of those traveling business bro consultants that Hodgman is annoyed by (we mostly deserve it). During that time, I was flying between 150-300 times a year (for over a decade).

I lost count of how many celebrities I sat next to on planes. The thing is, plane etiquette doesn't change just because the person in a celebrity. Mostly I would just give them the slight nod when sitting down, then do my best to aggressively ignore them so I could read, work on my laptop, whatever.

If they were feeling chatty, then I'd stick with safe topics (travel, how do they like (whatever) accessory or product they have with them, maybe talk about booze or food). Never talk about work, because a lot of the guys on these flights are in sales and you are inviting several hours of boring chat about whatever they sell. So it's easy to not talk about work with a celebrity too.

All that said, the one celebrity that did make me lose my cool wasn't on a plane. A friend of mine is an audio engineer and we were supposed to go out for the evening, but he had work and told me to meet him at the studio and we'd head out from there when he was done.

What he didn't tell me was that he was recording ADR for Deborah Harry (aka Blondie). I am of the age where she was a massive star as I was changing from a boy into a horny teen. I loved her music and had a young boy crush on her at the time. So, yeah, instead of acting like a normal person I stared too long, laughed too loud and long, and couldn't really string two coherent sentences together when she asked me the most banal question about what restaurants were good in the area.

There's no good reason to say ""(God) Bless You"". Except that it's a thing we do. It serves no purpose, and is ""wasted effort"" I guess, in some readings of the interaction... But that effort is minimal, to say the least.

The position of the [plaintiff? Sneezer] is a quite valid one, though not particularly well argued. Why go through the onerous task of saying ""bless you"" and ""thank you"" from to to room?

The fact that he can thread that needle speaks to not only his insight and wit but also his compassion. It's truly remarkable. The fact that everyone I know listens to true crime podcasts hosted by boobs instead of JJHo is criminal.

Not only does this save you from the aggravating and messy task of restirring your peanut butter, it also makes it easier to spread, because you aren't dealing with dried out, extra pasty peanut butter.

WikiTextBot,"**Gävle goat**

The Gävle Goat (Swedish: Gävlebocken) is a traditional Christmas display erected annually at Slottstorget (Castle Square) in central Gävle, Sweden. It is a giant version of a traditional Swedish Yule Goat figure made of straw. It is erected each year at the beginning of Advent over a period of two days by local community groups, and has become famous for being destroyed in arson attacks during December. Despite security measures and the nearby presence of a fire station, the goat has been burned to the ground most years since its first appearance in 1966.

EccentricOwl,"Wanted to chime in after dealing with some of my own problems vis-a-vis mail. 

Accidentally or unintentionally opening mail, or opening it in an attempt to find the new owner if the address is wrong, etc., lacks intent, and is pretty difficult to prove as a crime. (Keeping a package on Amazon that was misdelivered to your house can get the cops on your case, though!) 

Keep in mind, destroying mail addressed to someone else does not allow as much flexibility. This includes throwing someone else’s mail in the trash. It is far better to return a letter, even if you opened it by mistake.

Furthermore, Mail addressed to someone else may contain the subtext “or current resident” and is perfectly legal for you to open. In the letter-writers case, that counts as solicitation. The US Postal Inspection Service is not likely to hunt you down. 

However, if it's coupons... 

**If all else fails, you can just mark the letter ""Not At This Address"" and return it by sticking it in any post office box.** 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Form a business standpoint, I have a hard time imagining that these coupons were really some sort of ""OutSTANDING deal"" if they were just a bundle thrown in the mailbox. You guys get those bundled mailers all the time, right? 

I bet the business would *much rather* have someone visit their store and spend money (that they wouldn't normally spend) than deal with endless hours of coupon mailing...",1566863445,maximumfun

Anyway, the end result is that I also went through the process of having it hammered out of my mouth, after which they packed the gaping hole with bone dust, let it heal, and then drilled a titanium post into it, finally putting a fake tooth on top.

IF you like it and decide you want to go back to listen, my recommendation is to go back to listen from the beginning, as there are inside jokes that are basically lore at this point, like how Trevor sets out to ruin the show and don't be a Trevor (but now Trevor is OK and Louis is trying to ruin the show). Or how Manolo is actually an egg (basically a human version of Gudetama).

I love Gene Wilder in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I think a great game on Dr. Game Show could center around schnozzberries.
My favorite line from that movie is “a little bit of nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men.” Setting aside the cis-normative, misogynistic language of the quote, I think it holds true.

lawjr3,"Yes. This can and does happen. 

Or it did happen. 

Non digital film had a lot of that stuff in the shot. 

Because theaters varied in screen size, it wasn’t always a guarantee you wouldn’t see a boom mic or some cables on the ground. 

It’s also one of the reasons a lot of the movie websites that like fun at continuity errors don’t include when a boom drops into shot.",1564288708,maximumfun

MrCougardoom,"Susan Sontag's 1964 Essay ""Notes On Camp"" is an essential aesthetic guide to the cultural anomaly known as ""camp"". It's a fun read, but fairly artsy and esoteric so for it to randomly come up during this discussion was profoundly silly; especially in terms of it in regards to camp itself, as it was said in knowingly bad taste, though apropo of nothing so the comment about camp also became campy itself which was a funny multiplier of sorts. Also taking into consideration it was an off-the-cuff comment, it really got to me. Hope that helps.",1564176841,maximumfun
