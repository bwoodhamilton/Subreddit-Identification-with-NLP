nsermo,1579933396,"Ok, so I've been thinking this ever since I listened to episode two. There's a moment when, reminiscing and lamenting about what sounds like a perfectly fine life, Gregor says (completely serious) ""Where's *my* Astoria?"", referencing a six degrees acquaintance who became president of Astoria. 
In this moment I rolled my eyes so hard I almost went blind. All I could think was ""ugh just another mediocre white dude who feels so entitled to success that he feels ripped off that he hasn't gotten his equivalent of a PRESIDENCY yet?"" 

I listened to the whole episode. I grew to like Gregor a little, he can be funny, but that comment puts all his behavior and comments into perspective. He didn't win any further points with me when Moby was vulnerable and brave, and he immediately turned it back around on himself-- ""I appreciate you making that story up to make me feel better"".  Bruh. This guy just poured his heart out about almost committing suicide and you can't even muster a ""wow I had no idea I'm glad you're not dead"" ?!!

I was binging more heavyweight on a long drive today, and Gregor was back w an episode about his dad. As I listened to him call himself a genius, I thought again, God this guy kinda sucks. 
THEN I came on Reddit for confirmation of this take and.... No one has said this? Everyone just thinks he's hilarious??? So now here I am writing a long Ass post because this guy kinda sucks and it needs to be said, or else that exact kind of entitled bullshit continues to be considered acceptable.",gimlet,Heavyweight: Gregor kinda sucks

taylorkline,1579710539,"Here's how I read the dynamic and the pattern that I've seen before in my own relationships:

Man: Emotionally disconnected, except to occasionally express anger and exasperation, dragging along with an attitude of ""I'll be here because she's working so hard and I wish that I could care but I just don't."" Has already been seeing other women.

Woman: Willing to try anything. Putting all of her effort into a dead relationship with an emotionally dead man who is clearly just along for her ride.

I have so many questions from the counseling this episode:

1. Why did Esther keep praising the man for his angry outbursts? I thought for sure that she would suggest a strategy for him to express his emotions better, but she never did. She said that the woman's tears with the man's cool facade make for a poisonous combo, but is it really any more beneficial in a relationship for a man to express himself with contempt and anger and describing ""what pisses him off""?

1. Why did Esther focus on how they could get back together as a couple? Until the very end of the episode, when Esther starts suggesting a few things they can do to revive their relationship, I thought the focus of the counseling was on how the couple could divorce amicably while keeping the business going. The man seems pretty done, don't you think?

1. How is the woman initiating sex with the man going to help anything at this point? They have already established that, if they have sex, it means significantly more to the woman than it does to the man and they feel extremely unbalanced after.

If there are any books, articles, or YouTube videos that anyone can recommend for further study on relationships with dynamics like this one, I'd definitely check them out!

Also, if anyone knows if this podcast is being discussed anywhere besides on Reddit, please let me know as I would love to lurk and participate.",gimlet,"The Esther Perel episode ""Separated at Home But Still Together at Work"" really showcased a lot of toxic patterns in my own past relationships.

bananasenpijamas,1573065742,"I've never really gotten into fiction podcasts nor podcasts lacking a narrative host, but MOONSHINE just really blew me away. 

https://twitter.com/i/status/1173653126055784450

It's a beautiful story of James (voiced by actor and comedian [Joel Kim](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Joel_Kim_Booster)), a late 20's gay first-generation Korean immigrant who still lives with his widowed mother, who doesn't know he's gay, in suburban Los Angeles. 

The story is inspired by true events in James, our Gimlet producer's, life. Beyond the story, I fell in love with the sound design and the risks the show took in putting something out there that doesn't already exist. (It's not exactly suitable for children). 

Anyway, go check it out. I went from listening to the first episode and wondering if I was ever going to finish the six-episode series to shedding tears on the subway in both episodes 5 and 6.",gimlet,Go listen to MOONFACE - a show you've never heard of from a Gimlet Producer

There isn't really much mainstream digital art news out there.  It's the standard for most popular art industries, but people just don't write very much or very well about developments in it, so it's hard to find interesting story leads.

I think I used to think it was okay, even occasionally funny, but it has gotten progressively ramped up to the point where I find their interactions completely unappealing. ""Jackie"" is so exasperated and seemingly annoyed by Jonathan that it makes their dynamic seem pitiful.

I don't think it helps to have found out that Jackie (the person) was a bit of mean popular girl when they were kids. I feel increasingly we see that quality emerging in these interactions.

Again, I know this isn't a hidden microphone situation. I know they are probably outlined if not scripted, but I just don't find them enjoyable to listen to.

It sets a bad mean-spirited tone for a feel-good show. Ill-advised. I wish they'd drop it entirely...or make a two minute Jonathan and Jackie podcast for fans. Bonus content.",gimlet,"Unpopular opinion: I don't care for the ""Jackie"" character at the start of Heavyweight"

Details on new series MOTHERHACKER

&gt; Bridget’s life is a series of dropped calls. Fresh from a divorce, this strong-willed single mom is down to her last dollar when she gets hacked over the phone. Desperate to get her money back, she enlists the help of her teenage daughter’s tech-whiz boyfriend and tracks down her hackers. But things take an unexpected twist when she falls in love with her intended target—the head of digital security for one of the largest corporations in the US. *Motherhacker* is written by Sandi Farkas and directed by Amanda Lipitz. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cast is lead by Carrie Coon, Alan Cumming **AND** Alex Goldman of Reply All!",gimlet,"Gimlet Fall Fiction Slate: New series Motherhacker Dolores Season 2, The Two Princes Season 2"

octomoosemiester,1567028067,"So a friend told me that she's considering investing her savings in selling on Amazon. All kinds of bells started going off because I remember a podcast episode about people getting stuck with hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of merchandise that cannot not be sold. I thought it was an episode of Reply All. Looking through the backlog I see the episode on the fake reviews. Was it mentioned in there? 

It was definitely a cautionary tale about getting sunk into the Amazon seller marketplace. The merch is shipped and sold by Amazon and you have to purchase upfront. Maybe perhaps the seller also owns and maintains the listing. I remember someone saying they had signed up and bought a bunch of items (if I remember correctly it was something small and inexpensive) but it turned out the market was flooded and they have these tchotchkes they can't sell. 

Any help is appreciated....",gimlet,Reply All episode related to Amazon sellers?

I suspect this part of the fallout of the purchase of gimlet media by Spotify.

A look at the gimlet podcast pages, e.g., https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all, reveals that there is no longer a simple link to find an RSS feed for the podcast. That sucks.

atlvahi,1561460344,"After listening to the Rose episode on Heavyweight for the first time the other day, I did about a minute of Google Sleuthing and found her blog called Happie Hippie Rose that hasn't been updated in years.

She talks about the sorority issue on her blog and at the end asks if anyone knows why she was kicked out. She updates it at the bottom in red posting that there's a rumor she did cocaine off a toilet seat and some sorority sisters came forward. She says it never happened and that if that's the reason, they kicked her out over nothing.

1) i'm wondering why that never came up in the podcast.

2) Whether it's true or not (I doubt it, but that's not the point) - it would make sense they couldn't tell her why they kicked her out. If it was drug related, wouldn't they be at risk for documenting that? It would expose the sorority for some kind of termination from the school I would imagine. And if Rose knew that was the reason, she would potentially go to the school and expose the sorority for their hard partying ways. Though I'm guessing she could have done that anyway. 

3) Rick sounds like a great guy. But I wonder if they were possibly linked to the same rumor, and again, same reason why he doesn't know why he was kicked out. 

4) The oath thing is kind of over the top and creepy, but if they're all still mad at Rose, etc. then they wouldn't have any loyalty to her so why share with the world that they're unclassy ladies despite running around whisper PEARL! in each other's ears?

Thoughts?",gimlet,Rose from Heavyweight - She posted a theory on what happened her own blog about 7 years ago.

Lately though the inconsistencies and cryptic nature of releases have been bizarre. I get that it’s free entertainment - we’ve been blessed to get the episodes we have and we aren’t entitled to any of it. I just think some clarity would be nice. When they first announced a slow down it felt temporary but it’s been over a year since then. In the last 10 weeks we’ve had a yes-yes-no and 2 narrative episodes. 

That output is totally fine but I almost wish it was a season format so the team could have time to put together some releases with predictable breaks between. It just feels like there’s a disconnect where the show has gotten more money and more staff but the production has slowed. Maybe the team is working on other things or maybe the show has just gotten way harder to produce.. but a straight up answer to where the show is going would be incredible.",gimlet,Can we talk about reply all??

&amp;#x200B;

One thing in the conclusion to this story struck me though. I am German and my following description as to why Americans are so vulnerable to scammers is applicable to any society, please do not feel offended (also, opinion obv.). 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what he says: 

 *POPE: (exhales) Don’t you want to be rescued? I know I do. \[laughs\]  You know? When somebody stands up and says, “You know what? Bring me  your anguish, bring me your problems, and I will fix them. I will make it alright.” You know, that puts Brinkley in a line of demagogues going  back to the dawn of time, right up through today.* 

&amp;#x200B;

He's absolutely right, but one thing that's missing here is the manifestations of society. New people come to life in new generations and is the obligation of their predecessors to give them the education, material and perspectives to live a wholesome and educated life. 

&amp;#x200B;

What makes America special in that sense is that is so ultimately divided. Neo-liberals on the one side and moderate to liberal democratic forces on the other side, which do embrace their mission to make a better world far more then the others. The big issue here, which is just the same in Germany: We are constructing our societies on materialism almost exclusively. In school nothing was more important than success. We don't teach society we don't teach that class systems make a society as a whole vulnerable. Everything that matters is the individual and as we linger in this world on the leash of late capitalism and in solitude we look for exactly what Pope described above. 

&amp;#x200B;

We centralize societal accomplishments and attribute them to single humans, just take actors or directors as an example. We are extremely bad in seeing the intricate preceding works of people in different classes. We fail to see the injustices imposed on lower classes who then tend to look for the demagogues, rather living in illusion than solution.

The most recent episode was mainly a re-broadcast of an old episode

The epsiodes are no as ambitious or memorable. Take for example Long Distance, The Boy in Photo, Zardulu or On The Inside - to name my favourites.

The most recent episodes, such as the likes of Adam Pisces, Roman Mars or The Reply All Hotline, don't even come close.

I didn't bother listening to it, but I heard they did a joke episode with Jason from HDTGM. I love the comedian - but this is not a comedy podcast! By all accounts this wasn't great.

an insanely bloated company. nobody needs that much money or staff or a network to put out a HQ show. the revenue they will require to keep that going will mean giving so much control over to advertisers that the content will inevitably suffer. please tell your students.

That sums up about 90% of what was covered. The rest was mic placement.

@wjmaggos
Podcasting matters because of the independence it allows creators, allowing for a true diversity of opinion. Individual truths  change culture when they go from being hidden to widely embraced, and so help us see each other more fully. Ads, networks and paywalls go against that.

Chenjerai Kumanyika
‏ @catchatweetdown
@wjmaggos Thanks for your thoughts. I find your analysis here a bit reductionist but I agree that in the arc of media history ad-funding works against journalistic autonomy and democracy.


‏ @catchatweetdown
The threat of ad-funding &amp; venture capital censor &amp; shape content &amp; nudge journalists &amp; ""storytellers""in particular directions in explicit &amp; subtle ways that don't tend to be captured in the utopian discourse of podcast networks


‏ @catchatweetdown
@uncivilshow we were not free from these pressures, although there was never anyone over our shoulders telling us what we could or couldn't say. In fact, we were encouraged to be as radical as needed to be and given tremendous autonomy.

‏ @catchatweetdown
For that reason, @Gimletmedia &amp; similar networks are an important laboratory for these questions. The growing power of ad-funding &amp; venture capital must also be faced &amp; negotiated by the tens of thousands of independent podcasts that currently rely on these funding structures.

‏ @catchatweetdown

badhusbamd,1555439949,"Hey everyone 👋

So first off good news is my preferred app Podcast Addict just released an update that somehow fixes the input for 99PI. Unfortunately my app doesn't want to update right now but when it does I'll update.

Okay now onto the juicy bit. Many of you wanted to discover if any other combo of % and letter would freeze my car. Well boy oh boy did I make a strange discovery. Y'all **% I alone doesn't freeze my car**. What I didn't realize is that my attempts always had an In- word like ""66% Inconceivable"". I guess I just forgot to test %I on it's own because it works.

So here's the thing, the culprit all along was N!!! **%N and %n both freeze my car.** So somehow %In ignores the I and hits n and it freezes. What's stranger is that it only ignores a capital I. Multiple other letters before an n like %Dn do not freeze car.  

So to recap here's what freezes it

% In
% N

tentativeness,1554328278,"In light of the recent story of Gimlet's resistance to its employees unionizing (read about that [here](https://gizmodo.com/whats-gimlets-problem-1833639322)), I've started wondering...

**Should listeners boycott Gimlet shows until the union is recognized?**

First, cards on the table: I'm a huge fan of Gimlet shows--I've been around and loyal since the beginning--and I subscribe and listen to nearly all of them. I'm also very pro-union. If you're not as sympathetic to unions, much of what I say here won't be of much interest to you. 

Typically, when companies behave badly, we are right to exercise our rights as consumers in a directed way in order to enact change--namely, by boycotting, sometimes publicly, a company's products or services until the actions are reversed or the problems improved.

Of course, boycotts are often foolish. (See, for many reasons: Smashing one's previously purchased Keurig machine...) But this doesn't seem to be of that sort.

Or you might worry that boycotts are ineffectual. ""They won't do anything,"" some say. ""One individual act won't make a difference."" These are familiar concerns, and there's a lot we can say about them. But most of us think boycotts generally have some value, especially when coordinated and deliberate.

You might worry that the costs are too high by boycotting. ""It would harm the shows and producers I care about,"" you might say. I'm skeptical of this argument. Even if it were true, it would be because the boycott is at least relatively effective, and management refuses to capitulate. This latter effect is entirely in the hands of management. And clearly having the benefits of a union are important to Gimlet employees, so this may be the best way of showing solidarity with those producers who are fighting for better workplace rights and pay.

**So, *if* you think boycotts are generally defensible, and *if* you think the union's demands are legitimate (I do), and *if* the costs are acceptable (I think they are), *and if* you agree that a coordinated effort among listeners to show solidarity with Gimlet workers is important, *then* it seems there is a good case for a boycott until conditions improve.**

A boycott would consist of unsubscribing and not listening to shows. One could always go back and listen to these later if the union is officially recognized. More could be done in the public forum, but this is a first step.

I've tried to lay out the case for a boycott, but I'm also happy to hear criticisms or worries. Thanks for reading.",gimlet,Should we boycott Gimlet shows until the union is recognized?

""According to Cracked.com in 1988, a kid named Saul was bullied by five kids who pushed him against the lockers and beat him. He begged his parents to switch Schools, but they couldn't. After months he began to listen to dark music and cut himself. So his parents made a show on public access under their son's complete control.

It's not exactly known when the show first aired, but it can be assumed it aired at least a few months after their son's experience.""

https://lostmediaarchive.fandom.com/wiki/Goth_Public_Access_(1988_Public_Access_Show;_True_Title_Unknown)

I can totally understand why you would release trailers for new podcasts into the feeds of extant ones (though having the same trailer show up in 4 feeds is also annoying), but why on earth do they insist on releasing WF episodes in the StartUp feed all the time?

WF is not StartUp. The concepts are different, though the latter has rather left its roots behind and become something else entirely with more recent seasons. And if you think WF and StartUp are basically the same show, then why did you bother starting WF as a separate show with a fresh feed?

I know it's not a big deal, but it is annoying to me as a listener to see a new StartUp episode appear and go ""ooh!"" only to realise it's the same WF episode I listened to weeks ago, and then have to delete it from my feed.

buffalorosie,1551199118,"I binge listened to Conviction over the span of about a week.  I loved the storytelling and really appreciate this type of journalism, tackling such a massive issue like the criminal justice system, and fleshing out the many complicated layers of all involved. 

&amp;#x200B;

Did anyone else check out the whole season?  Thoughts? 

&amp;#x200B;

It reminded me of Serial Season 1, so much.  

...

Quasi Spoilers:

&amp;#x200B;

About Manny, in general-

&gt;!I have some complicated mixed feelings about Manny.  I'm curious to know more details about him as a supposedly overzealous cop.  That seems like a stretch to me. I ultimately found myself on his side, and I could appreciate what he was trying to do, even if others found his methods unorthodox.  I don't think what he was asking these kids to say about the police corruption sounds like that much of a stretch.  I wish that he was more diligent in his note taking and his methodologies, so that his work couldn't be called into question. !&lt;  


&gt;!He's a weird dude, but ultimately I felt like Manny is a good guy and he's fighting for justice and the underdog, and he isn't afraid of the big bad system.   The whole incident with the ex-gf cutting her hand on his car and him drawing a weapon... that seemed like a chaotic nightmare fueled by high emotions.  I could just imagine her bleeding and screaming and this mob of people coming at him.  The dude did NOT react well, but I didn't get the sense that he's constantly abusing his power, or rather - when he was a cop, that he was abusing his power.  I think he has a messy style and he's hellbent on exposing the corrupt cops out there.  He has a chip on his shoulder, for sure.   Am I being too easy on him? !&lt;

Well, I've daringly branched out from being a perpetual reddit lurker to tell you that it's actually pretty fucking great. 

I've been disappointed to see that The Cut on Tuesdays regularly has few to no comments on its episodes. Yet the show takes a fearless, often hilarious look at women's issues. It's tackled taboo or taboo-adjacent topics like pubic hair and sex in fiction with wit and nuance. The guests are consistently excellent, but my favorite part is hearing the candid conversations between the host, Molly Fischer, and her friends. Speaking of Molly, she's an absolute delight--wonderfully droll, warm but also sharply funny. I especially recommend the episodes on pubic hair (""Beat Around the Bush"") and weed (""Everybody Must Get Stoned"").

However, listening to Reply All had some surprising help with my social anxiety, witch I have been struggling with for a long time. It’s so relaxing to listen to just a bunch of happy people talking to each other, openly about so many things. It’s very therapeutic for me. From listening I also learn to catch on to social cues, which I didn’t have a chance to learn in my early life. I feel like reply all had helped me feel more comfortable and relaxed with my friends. Now that I’m running out of reply all episodes, I guess there must be more podcasts similar to it. They don’t have to be about the internet or anything specific. As long as they are happy people chatting randomly, it would be great.",gimlet,"Is there any podcast that is similar to Reply All, where there are just a bunch of happy goofy people talking about random stuff?"

acjohnson55,1546243937,"I'm a former teacher. I did Teach For America in Baltimore, where I taught at a charter school, intended very much to be like Success Academy. This is one of the better pieces of reporting I've seen on the world of education reform.

I was the founding high school math teacher. It was *by far* the most difficult thing I've ever done in my life. I clearly remember the sense of urgency and responsibility for those kids' life options. Also familiar was the coaxing of noncompliant students out of our school and into the local zone school they attend by default. 

The stress crushed me. I barely made it through my two-year commitment, and then I left the field. 

I journaled my story: [http://alanjayteaching.wordpress.com/](http://alanjayteaching.wordpress.com/)

This series did a stellar job capturing the pros and cons of the Success Academy approach. One piece of context they didn't really touch on is that Success Academy didn't invent this. They are one of many schools representing the ed reform movement, which was kicked off in earnest with No Child Left Behind. Broadly speaking, it's a bipartisan movement to apply the neoliberal philosophies of the business world to K-12 education, particularly in low-income communities. Success Academy is exemplary in its aggressiveness to scale, its stridentness, and its uncompromising approach.

*Does it work?* Well, that depends on what you're measuring. You're going to get high test results and impressive college admissions. These are the first-order proxies for success. The series does a really good job of exploring some of the caveats. In particular, I strongly agree with the criticism that these sorts of schools tend to help people in the upper tier of urban poverty. It's great to serve this population, which is very much in need. But we must recognize that it leaves the standard public schools with ever more highly concentrated social dysfunction to deal with. And then we label those schools as ""failing"".

But I think the more important question is whether people with means would accept that same model for their children. In most cases, I think the answer is almost as ""hell no"" as the traditional public schools. It's kind of like, pick your poison: totalitarianism or anarchy.

If we're really honest, all of this is only a problem because we consider our wealthy schools too precious and fragile to bother them with the responsibility of educating a fair share of the most needy children.",gimlet,Success Academy touched about 1000 nerves

As always, the story is a lot more complex. Sean's family did not actually own the property, instead his mother did and the family was living with her and paying her $500/month rent. When the mother sold her house to the village, she neglected to mention that she had tenants, so presumably all the money went to her (140% of property value + 54k moving costs). 

The village provided Sean and his family a place to live rent free + $2,000 to make it good, I guess. But no $22,000 that he was promised before the village realized that him and the mom would be double dipping. So yeah, Sean was screwed over, but more so by his mom than the village. 

Sruthi, the reporter, should have included this in the show. I don’t want to be a conspiracy theorist and say that the reporter had some type of agenda to make the village look bad, but it takes years to gain trust but only a second to lose it.  Alex/PJ should issue a clarification of some type.

But when I listened to the James episode where Goldstein was supposed to be helping out a dear friend, I was really bothered by the fact he seemed to think Gimlet was responsible for bankrolling the event completely. I thought searching for golf clothes at the thrift store was amusing to listen to, but it gave off the vibe that if it weren't for the podcast, he wouldn't be willing to really do anything to encourage his friend to this important thing.

&amp;nbsp;

After hours of prep and waiting, I got wheeled into the OR and almost immediately the surgeon asks the nurse if she's been listening to any good podcasts lately, and how she's been liking Heavyweight. She said she's been really enjoying it and mentioned crying during one of the episodes (I forget which; it was one with a female name). 

&amp;nbsp;

So I said ""I love Heavyweight!"" And the doctor asks me what I like about it and the nurse asks what my favorite episode is. It was such a nice little moment to have minutes before being put under for the procedure, and it made me feel reassured thar I was in good hands!

(After our little back-and-forth, the surgeon mentioned both he &amp; the nurse have long commutes, so it seems like this is what they bonded over/how they know each other's listening habits).

lovegiblet,1543943058,"I'm always somewhat surprised by the anger about some of the Gimlet decisions on this sub.  The Crimetown Spotify decision, the inconsistent release schedule, some of the sponsor decisions, etc...  They kind of boil down to ""listeners aren't their number one priority"".  This is true, but not surprising.  

Companies have three groups to make happy - Customers, Employees, and Stockholders/Investors.  Companies put each of those things higher or lower on their priority list depending on what kind of company they are.  If they just want a sustainable business that does a specific thing and stays more or less the same size, then they don't need to rely on investors so much, and customers and employees take priority.  

If they want to be a dominating force in their industry, like Adam has said Gimlet was created to be, then they need growth.  Growth means money, money means investors.  That's what they rely on, so what investors want weighs heavily on their decision making.

Adam said in the Nina Jacobson Without Fail interview that he has realized that Gimlet is in the business of making hits.  They are not in the business of making niche shows with a small dedicated following, they want the ones that everyone is talking about and think pieces are written about.  That's what investors want.  That may be why Reply All doesn't pump them out every week, they put lots of energy into things that take a while but have a huge impact, like trips to India and such.  

There are podcast companies that do not have the kind of venture capital investments Gimlet does. Maximum Fun is an example, they rely much more heavily on listener support.  One model isn't necessarily better than the other.  The capital that Gimlet has allows them to swing for the fences, which can be great.  MF isn't sending anyone to India.  They make a different product with different customers.  MF is selling to a small group of listeners that will send them $5 a month, and Gimlet is selling ears to advertisers, and numbers to investors.

So if Gimlet makes decisions that don't conform to your ideal version of what podcasts should be, don't be surprised. They are not looking to completely satisfy you.  They have different customers.   It's like a small soda company that carefully sources their ingredients vs Coke. Obviously the small company's soda is going to taste better, but Coke doesn't care, they use corn syrup because they aren't looking to make the best tasting soda, just the best selling soda.

Gimleteer,1543557608,,gimlet,StartUp - Success Academy 3: The Test
PM_ME_MICHAEL_STIPE,1543547048,"There's a famous Michael Eisner quote about the relationship that Disney has with profit:

&gt; The pursuit of making money is the only reason to make movies. We have no obligation to make history. We have no obligation to make art. We have no obligation to make a statement. Our obligation is to make money, and to make money, it may be important to make history. To make money, it may be important to make art, or some significant statement. To make money, it may be important to win the Academy Award, for it might mean another ten million dollars at the box office. Our only objective may be to make money, but in order to make money, we must always make entertaining movies. And if we make entertaining movies, at times we will make history, art, a statement, or all three. We may even win awards. 

I'm not sure Alex Blumberg would love the comparison, but I can see this ethos with the way that Gimlet operates. Under the auspices of creating bespoke quality shows, Gimlet has created shows with good profit margins. Some of the shows are, in fact, incredible and thoughtful in ways that a great deal of non-ficiton podcasts aren't. Others are betrayed by the drive for profits and end up being lackluster, rushed, or overtaken by advertisements. 

Look no further than Gimlet's fiction series for great examples. Homecoming is a pretty good show with good voice talent and sound design. It's nothing special, but it was a fun ride. It was clearly made as a TV pitch. The director, writers, and actors were not podcast veterans. Instead, they had connections to books and films. Where Homecoming fails, it fails because the people making it did not know how to make a podcast (see Steal The Stars for a much better podcast from the same year that does not have these shortcomings). The pitched worked, though. Homecoming is a well-regarded TV series now. The same can't be said of Sandra, which fumbled on its premise by not telling enough of a story and having short episodes that were sometimes almost half advertisements. Dolores Roach is another such failure, never breaking out from it's Sweeny Todd-alike premise, not to mention the tonedeafness of the home security ads on a show about minorities suffering as a result of gentrification. These 2 podcasts failed in part because profit margins drove Gimlet to make poor decisions for the sake of getting big names and hinting towards movie pitches. 

A side-by-side comparison of Heavyweight and Mystery Show also sheds some light on the consideration of profit. The shows have a similar premise and feel to them. Both hosts use their incredibly charisma and radical kindness to focus in-depth on a subject and really pick apart the minute things. However, Heavyweight is far cheaper to make and production can happen on a shorter timeline. Mystery Show was just too expensive and too hard to make, awards and adulation be damned. It just wasn't worth it to Gimlet to keep making the show. 

That idea of ""not worth it"" is central to my idea here. If Gimlet were a place where bespoke, creative podcasts could have free reign, then Mystery Show would still be there. It certainly wasn't canceled because it wasn't good enough. Some things are too expensive for Gimlet and don't fit within its profit margins. Gimlet has no obligation to make history. It's obligation is to make money. As far as I know, Gimlet isn't squeaking by, barely making ends meet. This was about maximizing profit, not cutting loose something that was tying them down. There's nothing particularly novel about this. Under capitalism, this is expected and even required in the face of competition and the ever present threat of being forgotten about and unprofitable. I bring this up because it makes the Startup Season 1 Alex look naive and removed from the current state of the company. It's a place where Mystery Show, their best show on the network, can be canceled because it's too hard and too expensive.

There's a line in a [WHY? song:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxoe91ZamIU) ""Who cares if a man blinks in Morse code when he sings if he sings his heart out? Everybody's gotta get paid!"" I'm sympathetic to this idea and it's why I continue to listen to impactful podcasts like Reply All and Heavyweight. I still feel the pain of an opportunity lost, though. Gimlet could have been a network that can handle profit losses like Mystery Show out of an obligation to make history, art, a statement, or all three. 

To quote the song again, ""a steady hurt and a sturdy purse,"" indeed. ",gimlet,On the Intersection of Gimlet and Profit

LOSTonABC,1543502125,"No idea if they read this or not.

I can understand the frustration of seeing this episode was a promotion for another show that has been out for a while - because even I opened PocketCasts and saw a new one and was like ""hell yea.""

I think the biggest issue - is that there is no rhyme or reasoning behind the release schedule of the newest seasons, or actual new episodes from Gimlet - at least from an audience perspective.

I look at Gimlet as a highly reputable entertainment company that caters to many different tastes from the audiences that get into podcast listening - so it is puzzling on the lack of communication that I see (especially since they have two different avenues with Gimlet Media and Gimlet Creative). 

The biggest example of this for me was Crimetown. I think that besides Reply All - this is my favorite show since I am a true crime buff. I had no idea that season 2 was a Spotify exclusive. I never downloaded the first episode or the previews because I was waiting for a few more to come out so that I could binge them. Not once did I ever think they would cut off a part of the audience and I had to look it up after a few months because I thought they had canceled the show.

I feel that Gimlet would truly benefit from having a format that gives their audience that itch of expectation. The only way I know if there is a new episode of any of their shows is to open the app I use, hit refresh, and see if there is anything. If I see that it is promoting ""3 new shows"" or something like that - I usually do not download that because my expectation was an episode of that specific podcast and I go elsewhere.   

What if they had a short and sweet podcast that updated weekly called ""Gimlet Updates"" or ""Gimlet News"" that filled in their audience on everything content wise that we would need to know? Even if it was just Sruthi walking around the office asking people whats coming - I know people would listen.    

It could go over new episode releases, trailer clips, promote new shows, etc.  It is just an idea - but having something like this would help out a lot. It would alleviate things like today where I am falsely excited for a new episode as well as properly promote upcoming items instead of needing to do so through the feeds of other shows.

Anyone else feel this would benefit them or have other ideas?

However, in addition the reduced number of episodes, the quality seems to have significantly dropped, and the qualities that make Reply All, Reply All, seem to be absent. In particular the last few episodes haven't been at all the same, with relatively little spoken by PJ and the Alexes. The most recent episode (Autumn) is, for all intents and purposes, *not* Reply All at all, featuring a guest who speaks the entire time, and only a few words from the hosts at the beginning, and the end.

\- Man oh man did I want David Schwimmer to reprise his role. The directors added some interesting texture with the character's family life, but while Cannivale was conniving and evil, Schwimmer's was pitiful and desperate. Cannivale's one-dimensional ""bad guy"" portrayal was less interesting than a bad dude who thinks he's doing good. Also: Schwimmer's ""I""m going to have to stop you right there"" was so much more memorable than Cannivales.

\- The letterboxing was infuriating at first, then I grew to like it. The aspect radio (was it 4:3?) added with those zooms and title cards gave it a real ""Twin Peaks"" feel. I missed the transition away from letterboxing when Heidi heard the bird - the ""Vertigo"" zoom &amp; track effect distracted me from it, but the return of the letterboxing was tragic and apparent when Heidi's lost her memory left.

\- I missed the character of Temple, who was split into 3 characters in this series. I liked the exasperated pragmatism of the podcast's character, and the corporate dismissiveness of Temple's secretary

\-I didn't think the pelican was the right choice. The auditory cue of the bird's call was so much stronger in the TV series, and a pelican squak (if you can call it that) left a lot to be desired

First off, most of this work was done by the person [hosting these files](http://www.supernintendochalmers.net/wiretap/), who seems to go by chalmers2006, or maybe it's supernintendochalmers. They also compiled the guide document from which I took the episode descriptions. This person has put up an [unofficial podcast feed](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/Wiretap_Unofficial_Podcast), but it seems to only have episodes from season 5. 

When I started poking around inside the file index, only the episodes from season 5 showed up, so that might be why the unofficial podcast is missing episodes. When I started making the document I realized I could guess the episode titles, and they reappeared in the index, so that's pretty much the extent of my contribution to this. My layman's opinion is that I ""woke up"" the files and made the server start indexing them, but this isn't my area of expertise, so I'm not sure what happened.

If chalmers doesn't respond to my email I'd like to figure out a way to create a podcast feed, but until then, you can browse almost all the old episodes in my guide with links and descriptions. There are a few missing episodes, most of them from season 1, so if anyone knows where to find them I can add links.

I have these files backed up to a Google Drive, so if at some point in the future chalmers' website goes down, I'll update the document.",gimlet,Heavyweight listeners: I made Google Doc guide with links to seasons 1-5 of Wiretap

But there is one vet, Walter  Cruz (Stephan James), whom she grows closer to, and with every great  thriller or drama, there is more to the story than the surface level.

It’s best to get it out of the way now: this is easily one of the  year’s best shows. This season is exceptional in its acting, its  direction, its music, and its writing, all married together to create a  fascinating look at the effects of emotional trauma on the mind. Some  want to use it and others cure it, but more importantly, the personal  connection of two people talking proves the more potent drug the show  has at its disposal, how closeness can be a solution more than exercises  and regimen. It also comments on the concept of memory, and how it can  be malleable and ever-changing, how memories can make an imprint but  aren’t truly what we’re about.

Laura Lee usually wears glamour makeup styles. For her apology video, she chose a more subtle style. Did she mean to fool anyone? I don't know. Maybe she just thought it was the appropriate look for the subject. Did she choose red lids to support the crying illusion? Or because she worried might cry and she wanted to minimize how that might affect her looks?

Of course, the whole video is calculated and intentional. There are lots of edits. Every time she ""wipes"" at her face, her aim is careful so as not to disturb her makeup. She never addresses or engages with what exactly she's apologizing for. There's the phony T-shirt to the face (it never touches her face -- I guess she didn't want to wreck the shirt or the makeup?)

lazysnail_,1536858466,"Also joining the conversation is “The Horror of Dolores Roach,” [Gimlet](https://www.gimletmedia.com/)’s first foray into horror. If the world of “New America” pitches society into the future, “Dolores Roach” burrows into its underbelly. When we first meet Dolores, she is underground, hiding in an abandoned New York City subway tunnel. This is where you go when you’re pushed out of the margins of society’s margins. It’s happened because, as we will soon learn, she’s killed a bunch of people and stuffed them into empanadas, but also because of how the city’s racial and economic dynamics beat down on a woman like her.

After serving 16 years in prison on trumped-up pot possession charges, Dolores returns broke and confused to the newly gentrified Washington Heights. All of the her neighborhood landmarks have been replaced by T-Mobiles and Citibanks, its once-friendly faces supplanted by green smoothie-drinking white girls in workout clothes who are free to smoke their boutique hydroponic weed without incident. The only thing left is the local joint Empanada Loca and its owner, Luis (Bobby Cannavale), who opens the shop’s doors and his weed stash to his old friend. Despite all the indignities visited upon Dolores — and all the crimes she’ll commit in her tragicomic descent into madness — the tale is built on that tender emotional core. Breathing all these elements to life is the voice of Daphne Rubin-Vega — the original Mimi in “Rent” — whose performance as Dolores slinks into the listener’s mind in a way that feels unrivaled in audio. 

 “Dolores Roach” is adapted from “[**Empanada Loca**](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/theater/review-empanada-loca-a-tough-life-and-a-special-ingredient.html?module=inline),” a 2015 one-woman show staged by the Off Broadway Labyrinth Theater Company that also starred Ms. Rubin-Vega. Gimlet’s new head of scripted content, Mimi O’Donnell, is Labyrinth’s former artistic director, and “Dolores Roach” is the first series she’s overseen soup to nuts for the company. Part of Ms. O’Donnell’s pitch for the job played up the possibilities presented by cross-pollinating podcasting with the theater; playwrights are studied in telling stories with dialogue that are laden with metaphorical opportunity. 

##  And “Dolores Roach” is a virtual co-creation with Ms. Rubin-Vega, who originated both the title character and all the others in the one-woman show, and weighed in on casting and scripting on the podcast adaptation. “Her imprint on this is enormous,” Ms. O’Donnell said.

1. Get religion out of my business
2. Churches are evil
3. Man, this seems nuts

I can't really do anything about Gimlets content schedule, and I probably won't be able to change your fundamental opinion about religion, but if you're one of the people who has questions about church plants, why evangelicals do what we do, how we think or what we think, I'm happy to do my best to shed some light. For reference, I also go to a church called Restoration (no affiliation). It's a nine year old church plant in a major (mostly liberal) city, and I've been going there for about six years.

I am used to centralized and partially state financed churches. Sure there are some smaller and also american influenced churches, but they are often seen as fundamentalist christian sects.

* How do the churches earn money? Do they basically just give the hat around or is there some kind of a membership-fee?
* When is a church a church and when is it a business? Is this a question which can be a problem (legally) or is this straight forward? ( Because they treat it like a business, is it also legally treated as such)
* My thought trough the episode was: 'What?! Founding cults is a legitimate business? And this isn't seen as amoral?' Especially here I feel like this might be some cultural difference I don't understand.

**Here are a few of mine:** 

[Love Me](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/arts-culture/love-me/): A show with wonderfully edited non-fiction and fiction stories about intimacy. Pound for pound my favorite podcast for when I want to be punched in the gut. 

[Question of the Day:](https://www.earwolf.com/show/question-of-the-day/) The only unscripted podcast I've ever been able to get into, a question and answer format  show between entrepreneur James Altucher and Freakonomics co-author Stephen Dubner. They have fascinating chemistry together, and the episodes are short.

I skipped the last half of the Dov Charney season. Guy seemed like a jerk and besides not relevant at all. This season was interesting but didn't seem to belong on Startup with the amazing precedent set by the first 2 seasons.

MasonJack12,1530237164,"It's 2 female founders leaving public radio, trying to do their own thing (Manoush is awesome, and I would personally listen to anything she makes). Very similar to the first season in startup. The latest episode has then meeting with Roman Mars (co-founder of PRX and host of 99% invisible). They were pondering the venture capital route, and Roman said something that immediately made me think of Gimlet Media. He said something to the effect of ""if you take venture capital, you will have to grow fast, and then make stuff you won't care about"".

That sounds exactly like what Gimlet did. Started with a really good show (Start-up, season 1), and now they turn out a ton of podcasts, very few of which are outstanding, and even fewer of which were original ideas (ie they created it instead of buying a podcast that was previously a success elsewhere.)

Next week on Zigzag, Alex Blumberg and Matt Leiber are on the show.  I'm really interested to hear what they think they are today.  It may be a profitable business (not that start-up shares that sort of thing any more), but I would be surprised if they thought show quality remains where it used to be.",gimlet,Has anyone heard Zigzag?

podsinthekey,1528208210,"This week on my Simpsons podcast, Pods in the Key of Springfield, we've crafted a little 'Reply All' tribute episode about trying to hunt down an old Simpsons comic I had a letter published in back in the 90s. To really capture that Reply All goodness we decided to ask Alex Goldman if he'd be happy to record a cameo for us, and to our immense delight he agreed.

The episode is called 'The Missing Comic Book', and it's still working its way to some podcatchers, but you can find it on Podbean here: https://podsinthekeyofspringfield.podbean.com/e/the-missing-comic-book/ . It should be up on Stitcher, iTunes, Spotify, and elsewhere very soon.

One thing I've always loved about Reply All is how approachable the team feels, and having Alex agree to do this for us has just deepened my love for the show and everyone who makes it. We feel very lucky. ",gimlet,Alex Goldman recorded a cameo for our Simpsons podcast this week

Right now I listen to The Pitch (shark tank but for audio), How I Built This (stories of successful entrepreneurs), and Cool Idea! Podcast (Kickstarter creators), all of which have the elements of the early seasons of Startup.

zeptimius,1526456294,"I'v e only just discovered Reply All, and I'm listening to old episodes. I just now listened to the two\-parter ""Long Distance"" in which Alex travels to India to meet the people running the scammy call center that offered to ""fix"" his computer.

All through the second episode, I got the feeling that there was a big misunderstanding at play, that neither Alex nor the audience seems to have picked up on. 

The following things happen that may seem a bit strange from the call center's perspective:

* When Alex and his friend meet their contact, Kamal, he brings along the director of the call center, Deepak.
* Kamal and Deepak keep meeting with Alex and his friend, taking them to dinner etc.
* They want Alex to stop recording their conversations.
* They keep asking Alex what he wants.

Maybe it's just me, but it seemed pretty obvious what was going on: Deepak and Kamal thought that this was a blackmail operation, and were wining and dining the guys to get them to ask for a bribe. As I understand it, bribery is a very common thing in India, even among people who would consider themselves non\-criminals. So for a criminal operation, this would be a no\-brainer.

Think of it from Kamal and Deepak's perspective. Why would two random guys, even journalists, travel halfway around the world on the off chance of being able to meet some nobody who's harassing them over the internet? Why do these journalists want to talk them at all? From their mindset, the logical answer would be: because they want money.

Whether I'm right or wrong, to me, the episode becomes even funnier if you listen to it with this theory in mind. Here are these two\-bit criminals, trying desperately to get two ""clueless"" Americans to pick up on the hints they're dropping. They can't initiate the talks, because it would weaken their bargaining position, or expose them to prosecution if they're wrong. They're driven more and more crazy by the fact that nothing seems to work, and eventually they realize that this isn't about money at all. 

At this point, they start to panic. From this new perspective, everything they've been doing has been terrible. They've been exposing themselves to the world, which threatens their operation. They move fast to close the office, dissolve the company and so on. But why do they still talk to Alex? Because there's an alternative idea: the Americans are just playing hardball. It's only when they explicitly get told that they're terrible people who should be ashamed of themselves that the coin truly drops.",gimlet,"Late to the party: A theory about Reply All #103 Long Distance, Part II"

I've dealt with a persistent depression for about 5 years now, since junior year college.  I dont really know what started it, just that it at its best was just background noise in my life, and at its worst its caused me at times to cut myself off from all the people/things I love. It got so bad last year, that I dropped out of graduate school.  I quit the path I had wanted to be on since I was like 15 or something.  And since then i've kinda just being drifting along in life, no goals or wants or anything.  I've had a mentality of ""okay, this thing won I guess.  It has control of me and this is just how its going to be from now on."" I'd given up on things like therapy that I used to help cope in the past.

PJ was talking about his own experiences with depression in the episode when he said ""I can barely remember what being depressed felt like""...""its just this gray streak"".  And I hear/read a lot of stories about chronic depression(because thats what people like me seek out), but I've never heard one that ends with ""I can barely remember what it felt like.""  It was the most encouraging thing I had heard in a long time, and it gave me the motivation I needed to try and get better.

Sandra: April 18th 
Helen's always dreamed of ditching her hometown, so when she lands a job at the company that makes Sandra, everyone's favourite A.I., she figures it's the next best thing. But working behind the curtain isn't quite the escape from reality that Helen expected. Directed by Sebstian Silva; written by Kebin Moffett and Matthew Derby



The Habitat: April 18th 
On a remote mountain in Hawaii, there's a fake planet Mars. Six volunteers are secluded in an imitation Mars habitat where they will work as imitation astronauts for one very real... (can't find the rest of the description anywhere else an Overcast cuts it off here). 



We Came to Win: April 25th 
Every four years, people all over the world turn their eyes, ears, and hearts toward the most exciting sports competition on the planet: The World Cup. We Came to Win tells the stories behind the tournament’s most memorable moments. Like, how did one player become a God, and a villain, after breaking the rules? How did the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup save English soccer from falling apart? And how did one player turn a free-kick into an act of protest?


This series from Gimlet Media is an homage to the triumph and heartbreak, victory and defeat that we all experience from soccer (or football, or futbol, or whatever you call it). And it reminds us that so much of what we love about the beautiful game happens off the pitch.",gimlet,"Gimlet is releasing 3 new podcasts: We Came to Win (sports), The Habitat (fiction), Sandra (fiction).

BUT WAIT! He's a man-child who learns how to run a business from random quotes of the week. The montages at the end of every episode with the 'lesson of the week' voiceover are nauseating.

It's a very progressive show, though. Alex has to come to terms with his son dressing as a woman. In fact, it serves as a beneficial plot point without any further conflict arising because of it. 

The show did hit a bit of a rhythm during the 2 simultaneous meetings and a chuckle was involuntarily produced from my body when the one chick slammed up against the window during the meeting.

OoohMamaJohnnyBravo,1521730191,"How does a company with so many employees produce such little content? Gimlet has 100 employees for 13 podcasts, 9 of which are full time dedicated to Startup, but we haven't had an episode in 3 months now. Besides Startup Bus, the quality of the content has been lacking. Season 6 wasn't even about startups! That's a little ridiculous when other groups produce more, high quality shows with way less people. It seems as though the Startup group doesn't really have a solid direction for where they want the podcast to go. In my opinion there are two things I really want to hear:

&amp;nbsp;

1. I want to get consistent updates on Gimlet. Gimlet is still a startup, I would love to hear more about the challenges and success that Matt and Alex have had as the company grows. What kind of fires do you have to put out? How's the fundraising going? 

2. If you focus on other startups, don't make it a goal to write episodes in the traditional story telling way you'd make an episode of reply all. Ongoing businesses don't have a nice tidy end for you to wrap the podcast up with, and I don't think people care as much about hearing a traditional story as they do hearing the gritty details of what it's like to start a startup. Talk about what it's like raising funding and making first hires. When does a company get an office? What kind of marketing is a startup experimenting with?

Pantoner,1518805821,"I have been listening to Gimlet shows since day one, from the first episode of Start Up, before the company was even called Gimlet Media.  I was immediately blown away by the quality of Start Up. I had already loved Alex Blumberg's work on Planet Money and This American Life and had full faith in his taste and style of making podcasts

I've listened to every podcast Gimlet has released and am now only subscribed to Reply All and Heavyweight.  Reply All is one of my favorite podcasts of all time and has been rock solid since they started, same with Heavyweight.  It really sucked to lose Undone and Mystery Show, and I feel like the direction Gimlet is heading in is the wrong one.  

The shows they are releasing now are as interesting as vanilla ice cream, they aren't unique or groundbreaking and aren't anywhere close to the quality of Reply All or Heavyweight, neither in quality of content or production. 

The idea that I was once a Gimlet member seems insane, I don't have faith in this network as a whole and I really hope they can trim the fat and focus on creating better shows",gimlet,Is anyone else experiencing a declining interest in Gimlet?

Apparently, he was in Brazil for a while on their behalf and then disappeared again.

CopularSunfish,1511562563,"This is about the first episode from Gimlet Creative's ""Why We Eat What We Eat"". I know it came out a little while ago, but something about this episode rubbed me the wrong way. I like the podcast as a whole, though.

So this episode claims that Oberon Sinclair, a marketing professional, ""made up"" the American Kale Association to promote kale, and indirectly, herself. They make it like a super-shady, undercover conspiracy, but maybe I was missing something, because I can't see anything wrong with what Oberon and the Association were/are doing. She wanted to make kale into the next big thing, so she strategically marketed it. She ""made up"" The AKA in the same way that Alex Blumberg ""made up"" Gimlet media, from what I can see. There's nothing inherently wrong about it.

I guess I was just annoyed because it felt like this episode was making a big deal over nothing. For those of you who've listened to it, what do you all think?",gimlet,"I don't think ""Big Kale"" is that big of an issue."

PodSpective,1508367027,"Hey all, as promised I finished my review of Heavyweight! Here's to season 2 being just as good.

Review:
We all have moments in our past--relationships in our past--where two (or more) decisions presented themselves, and in making one or another, one of life’s roads was seemingly closed forever.  Maybe for you that moment was a breakup.  Maybe it was an apology--or lack thereof.  Maybe you forgot to text your friend back that one time and it represented the beginning of a gradual drifting apart.  They thought you didn’t care enough about the relationship.  Maybe they were right.  

These sorts of moments are what Jonathan Goldstein’s Heavyweight poignantly explores, and though he can’t take himself or his guests back in time to revisit them, he can help them now, in the present, make it right.  Or at least understand it better.  These moments are haunting, and it takes a certain sort of bravery to revisit them.  Jonathan helps his 80-something year old father Buzz reconnect with his estranged and reclusive brother Sheldon, with whom he hasn’t had a real relationship in decades.  He helps his friend Gregor and a certain electronic music superstar get over a falling out they had over some lent CDs 20 years ago that may or may not have played an absolutely vital role in launching said superstar’s career.  He helps himself understand what happened when he was dumped by his first true love in his youth, and why it continues to affect him so much to this day.  

These moments are like places that we revisit over and over in our minds.  Only, that’s not actually how memory works.  We’re not really revisiting them so much as reconstructing them each and every time we think about them.  With each reconstruction the moment slowly takes on new and accumulated meanings and emotions (some amplified and some deadened), and each aspect of the moment is viewed through the lens of the ever-changing even-now.  Even the so-called hard facts change shape with time.  It’s scary, but it’s true.  That’s why what Jonathan does with this podcast is so important.  His attempt to dig up the moment out of the past and place it squarely in the experience of the even-now helps to destroy or at least curtail its power.  It helps him and his guests learn to create new histories instead of reliving old ones. 
 
Oh, and by the way, he does all of this with a truly self-deprecating (in the best possible way) sense of humor.  Despite its seemingly serious and unabashedly emotional subject matter, the show is funny.  Full stop.  Jonathan injects humor into every moment, which might on the surface seem like a defense mechanism, but is actually more of a skillfully used tool of the trade.  I really don’t think I can do justice to this show here, but for for all of these reasons and more Heavyweight is a must-subscribe, so go listen to every single episode. 

You can find more of my reviews at my website, https://podspective.com/

2 Podcasts I really liked and sounded like it would it would fit Gimlet was IRL: Online Life is Real Life hosted by Victoria Belmont as well as Hackable by Mcafee. 

Personally, i'd like to see them do a Serial/S-Town based series, more fiction stuff as well as podcasts about technology, design, culture and maybe even a spiritual successor to planet money, as well as having more regular shows. 

What would you like to see them explore both in terms of content as well as more/less seasons/recurring shows?",gimlet,What new podcasts would you like to see from Gimlet?
MasonJack12,1507310259,"I just listened to this weeks episode about the guy who got out of jail and decided to start his own podcast.  Once again, a pretty long story that, as seems to be the trend, is light on the ""startup"" aspect, and heavy on the ""here's a story"" aspect.  

Maybe I'm alone, but this is just not what I want to hear.  This American Life and a bunch of others already do human interest (not sure if that's the right adjective) really well.  What has always made Startup so good and DIFFERENT has been a great story about actual startups.  Not the Chinese government.  Not a guy starting a podcast with no podcast experience.

So Gimlet, I know you plan to go back to the serial format, following one company through many episodes, but here is what I would love to hear:  A spin off that does single episode profiles of real, actual businesses.  I would 100% listen to something like that.  That's why The Pitch is so great.  I'm an uber-fan of anything Startup related.  It could be ""How I Built This"" for small businesses.

As Alex B said in the very first episode that Startup is about what it's really like to start a business.  It would be fantastic to get back to that.

To pre-empt the guy who tells me that ""it's free, so stop complaining"", I'll once again point out that a) this is a Gimlet thread, so I'm discussing Gimlet and B) Gimlet makes money from advertisers based on number of listeners, so we are vital to their business and income.  If they are making money off us, I can guarantee they'll want to know if their audience is unhappy.

Is there a pattern or meaning to this? Or is it a trippy experimental skit that's going over my head. Some noises do sound like they're played backwards.

It is super unsettling. Normally when I listen to the podcast, I stop it after the main part ends or I listen to it going to sleep, so I don't hear this segment. However I have on several occasions actually woken up to hear this segment on other episodes but it's been really disorientating so haven't actually realized it was apart of Reply All (because I'm groggy and don't know what is going on).

Mtbnz,1503591551,"Apologies up top if this has been explained elsewhere, but I've done some searching online and on this sub and I haven't seen anywhere an explanation of why Oscar Isaac is missing from this second season of Homecoming.

Were the creators unable to get him back for anything other than a few snippets on voicemails, or did they honestly think they had a strong enough concept for a second season that didn't involve Cruz?

I get that Heidi is the protagonist, but her story is directly tied to Cruz, so to reduce him to a macguffin, used to fuel the other characters to run all across the country chasing ghosts seems like a real waste of the character development from the first season.

So, what's the story? I know Isaac is a big star, but so are Keener, Schwimmer, Sedaris, Shawkat, Cera, Cross, Jonze etc.

Was it that they couldn't afford him? was he not interested? Scheduling conflict? Or was he never a part of the plan for S2? 

I'm interested to know, because the second season felt totally adrift without Cruz anchoring the narrative. Especially since he was still used as a plot device, but without any real presence. Was anybody conviced that 'the ongoing adventures of 3 bumbling operatives to cover their tracks while each trying to push the others in front of a bus' was as interesting as the tight narrative of season 1? I certainly could've done without the entire David Cross subplot, and a lot more Cruz.

If any of the Gimlet staff who monitor this sub are allowed to weigh in I'd be fascinated to hear the official explanation. /u/victoriajohanna maybe?

madali0,1503137571,"Hi guys, I know I'm late the party, but I've only been listening to Reply All a few weeks back, and started from the first episode. I finished the four part episodes only yesterday. I love the podcast, but this show left such a bad taste in my mind, that it has affected the way I view the show itself.

The thing I've always loved about podcasts, was that it was supposed to be a better alternative than traditional media. But I'm finding podcasts following the same route as blogs. Initially, late 90s and early 00s, non-professional content online was a more honest look at matters. Eventually, blogs became too ""professional"" where eventually, newspapers and journalists wrote blogs and bloggers wrote serious media, and the line was completely blurred. Blogs lost its initial appeal.

This is what the episodes felt like to me. If podcasts are going to try to emulate traditional tabloid storytelling, than what's the point of it? ""On the Inside"" turned out to be the same criminal TV/Book/Radio documentary that we have experienced for decades. 

My concern is not unique, as when I searched for this episode in this sub, I found the same criticisms. However, the bad feelings remains with me because sub an episode is directly affecting someone's life. And I don't listen to podcasts to see people's lives being used for entertainment, melodramatic, and dishonest purposes. 

Since Paul Modrowski did not yet respond to the podcast when it was released, obviously you guys did not comment on it when talking about the episode. However, I searched his blog today and found that he did write his response to the podcast, and it just makes me sadder that Gimlet is acting similar to traditional, tabloid journalism. 

Here is Paul's blog, 
http://paulmodrowski.blogspot.com/

Here is something interesting I found once I read the comments in this sub and then read the blog. In the comments on that episode, u/SinisterInfant mentions this ""Wasn't that head on a lance comment also a quote from Batman? I'm pretty sure the Joker says this to Vicky Vale in museum? I thought it was kind of a stretch to relate that comment to the murder.""

And this is what Paul himself writes, ""The transcript Sruthi read is a small and inaccurate excerpt from my conversation with Melanie. It also did not proceed from the break-in, but some quarrels I had with her parents and sister. I may have a dark and wry humor, but I was only joking. In fact, I was reciting the Joker in a Batman movie. She knew I was playing and we continued dating after that phone conversation""

Notice that a random redditor quickly understood that it might have been a reference, but a journalist that has been talking to him for a year couldn't catch it? Either Gimlet sent the wrong journalist to work on this case, or she was completely dishonest to begin with, and I'm sadly leaning towards the latter.

I haven't yet listened to the rest of the episodes, and I hope I can get this bad taste out of my mind, and I'm not sure if they did address this story again, but they should. I really wish Sruthi could have stayed away from traditional journalism trappings, and instead made a shorter, more concise, honest story. ",gimlet,"My Rant on Reply All's ""On the Inside"""

delhi_loafer,1501201331,"Long time Reply All listener here. This was such a great episode, Reply All at its quintessential best. 

This was specially interesting to me because I grew up where all these people Alex spoke to are. My home in Delhi is 5 minutes drive away from Accostings office on Club Road in West Delhi. I went to school which was like a couple minute walk from the office.  My family still lives there. So it was a bit surreal to listen this.

It is funny how obvious it is to anyone from the region to figure out within the first few words of the very first conversation that the fake American accent and the manner of speaking is of someone from North India if not Delhi. I loved how Kamal would switch his accent between fake American at work and normal Punjabi Indian accent when he would talk after work.
It was also interesting that one guy mentioned about America nuking Japan and how many Japanese newborns are still paralyzed because of the after effects of the bombs. This is exactly how I remember it being taught to us in school history class on the world war. 
 
Also, Alex Martin is Kamal Verma was clear much earlier in the episode. When the guy who puts Alex on hold is talking in Hindi, in the background he says something like ""Kamal Sir se baat ki thi. Kamal Verma ka naam le raha hai. Bahar se Skype call aayi thi. Kamal Sir ne isse bahot baate ki thi. Sunaya tha iske bare mein ki mat..."" in Hindi. This roughly translates to ""He spoke to Kamal Sir. He is taking Kamal Verma's name. A skype call had come from outside the country. Kamal Sir had a long conversation with him. He warned me about him"". Shruti Ravindran completely missed this in the translation from Hindi or maybe they intentionally left it out to keep the suspense for later.

Not sure if the accostings office is still up and running (the website is taken down). Only if I had know about this earlier, I could  have collaborated with Alex Goldman and sent a friend to their office, posing as him and looking for Kamal Verma just to freak them out.",gimlet,I grew up 5 minutes away from Accostings office in Delhi

Coming to Gimlet has taken the show to another level.  I love that they are less focused on valuations than Shark Tank (a conversation I got tired of long ago), and the VC people seem to be legit VC people, rather than rich people who are on the show to raise their profile.  

The latter part of the show (after the ""in person"" pitches are complete) make for really good listening because you get to hear what people really think from both an investor and founder perspective.

DivinitusRenes,1499891348,"I've never been big into podcasts. There are a couple I listen to relating to a tabletop game I play, but that's all.

But recently, my friend convinced me to try Science VS. It had me hooked right from the start. It has all the nice little things like a charismatic host and bits of humor sprinkled about. I'm hooked because of its focus on facts in the face of controversy, and their insistence upon research and fact-checking. They don't jump to conclusions, and they don't half-ass their research, and it's been consistently informative, even for topics I'm already educated on. I love it.

I caught up pretty quick and am now stuck waiting for the next episode to release. I've tried listening to a couple other Gimlet podcasts, but so far none of them are as satisfying. Undone was great, but short-lived. Every Little Thing and Surprisingly Awesome have been decent. Reply All feels a bit like listening to reddit's front page; I'll use it to pass the time occasionally, but it's not really ""enjoyable"" like the others.

So I'm looking for recommendations, and thought this might be a good place to ask. Are there other podcasts you think I might enjoy? Is there anything similar to Science VS you could recommend? I can enjoy most general topics, and especially love psychology/psychotherapy/neurology.

Edit: Wow, you guys have given me a TON of suggestions, and I'll definitely have to listen around and sample everything. Thank you so much!

And just to clarify a bit, in case anyone else has more suggestions - the thing that gets me about Science VS is that they follow through to the very end. They aim to educate in the most objective way possible and they don't skimp out at all. Some episodes of Reply All and Every Little Thing have left me feeling like I read the title of a r/todayilearned post, but it took me 20 minutes to read those two sentences.

Rappers and hip hop artists over the years have been known to watch anime and be somewhat influenced by it, but in recent years, it is gaining more and more prominence in the rap community.

I feel like this is a strange intersection of cultures that was predicted by no one. My theory is the prominence of Cartoon network in low income communities (especially boys in said communities) and their pioneering of anime in America. Lots of black kids living in the ghetto grew up on a healthy diet of anime. Here is a youtube video explaining how Cartoon Network led to the prominence of anime in America.

I understand that each branded podcast is produced in partnership with a company. This company is mentioned in the podcast and has its logo appear within the podcast logo.

Is there anything more to it? For instance, I heard an episode about Dr. Bronner's soap under the banner of the Virgin Airlines' ""Venture"" branded podcast. Was Dr. Bronner's also a brand partner?

If it's labeled ""Gimlet Creative"" should I just assume the whole thing is an ad? Not just the part where they name-drop eBay, etc.?

You guys, this warehouse is PART of the crime syndicate, right? 



*Firstly, if the packages with tracking devices sat there so long they lost their charge, that means it might not be just a shipping facility, but also the warehouse for stolen goods. 



*Secondly, if they are part of an organized crime syndicate, which they PROBABLY ARE, they are culpable. Is a chop-shop innocent because they did not steal the cars? 


*Thirdly, and I know this is a leap, but this could be part of Russian interference in the American way of life just like the election-meddling. (It would have seemed crazy prior to the election that Russians would care to meddle in our elections, but here we are). If they are spreading their brand of corruption and organized crime through America (and I can only imagine this is not a stand-alone facility), this could be part of an organized plot to denigrate American values. If we all know someone who has been the victim of fraud/theft the way this person was, it sends the subtle message to each of us that our institutions are corrupted and that we are not being protected by our government the way we should. This propagates a general sense of nihilism and malaise, disempowering the population and causing us to (subconsciously) begin to lose faith in our way of life.



There could be a VERY large story here. It would be not only extremely gripping, but also a great service to people. PLEASE follow through with this story.

LeopoldTheLlama,1497281545,"I'm a bit behind on my Science Vs listening, but I went back and there didn't seem to be a thread on this episode. I was a bit disappointed at the discussion of telomeres and telomerase in the mediation episode. I don't dispute what was said actually said about the association with heart disease and mortality, but it lacked any mention of the other half of the story -- **telomere shortening happens for a damn good reason**. 

The mechanism exists as a control on the number of cell divisions. Cells in the body have a number of these mechanisms, for an important reason: because **uncontrolled cellular growth is cancer**. Indeed, one of the hallmarks of genetic changes in cancer cells is [the activation/upregulation of telomerase]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hallmarks_of_Cancer) [1]. There's a popular narrative of telomerase as this elixir of life, and I've heard many otherwise educated people talk about how if we could just activate telomerase in somatic cells, we'd be immortal. Now, I think there are certainly possible benefits to the telomerase therapies that are being researched (including paradoxically the reduction of some occurrences of cancer) -- its a very complicated issue and activating telomerase *by itself* won't cause cancer -- but we shouldn't just talk about telomere's shortening as some *flaw* of cell division.

[1] I'd normally link to actual articles, but I think this wikipedia article has a very approachable summary and includes references to relevant literature.

On a related note, I think there's potential for another fantastic Science Vs. episode -- **Science Vs. Aging**. There are billions of dollars being pumped into research on extending the human life-span and there's a ton of misinformation about it out there.

ShlomoTheCat,1496762839,"I've posted complaints about Gimlet to this sub.  I hope that's okay - that this isn't just a fanboy/fangirl sub.  So, with that in mind, here's a critique of StartUp.

Listening to StartUp has really chapped my hide and I think that the podcast is somewhat pernicious.

Here's why.  StartUp is about as unthinkingly neoliberal in its approach to start ups as it can be.  The only kind of start up worth a full episode (to say nothing of more than one episode), the only kind of start up that merits any sort of journalistic attention, the only kind of start up that Blumberg and Chow apparently can even *imagine* is a for-profit business.

Furthermore, this drives Blumberg and Chow to represent success in building a start up as identical to securing financing and some kind of revenue stream.  It's as if the only thing human beings can create are commodities.  

That is a real shame.  For, people start up non-profit, community-based organizations *every day.*  And, the struggles are interesting and well worth reporting, to say nothing of celebrating them.  Building everything from a labor union to a food-not-bombs collective involves skills and struggles that are well worth discussion and that cannot be meaningfully distinguished from the skills involved in building a business from the ground up.   

There is, I think, something pernicious in the way that Chow and Blumberg treat for-profits as the only start ups worth covering.  It suggests that the only sort of creative, ambitious energy worth a story is creative, ambitious energy focused on making a profit.  It sends the message - even if it is not widely taken up and even if their podcast doesn't convince people - that the people who deserve our admiration and praise are people who seek to *make money* by building businesses.  The *absence* of any substantial narrative focused on non-profits speaks volumes.  

I realize people might get upset at this.  The show is explicitly about business!  But, there is no rule that the show must be about business.  After all, the show has been about a *lot* - from Gimlet to Dov Charney to a dating app.  Why not also about, for example, trying to organize a labor union, or trying to start up a nonprofit legal aid organization, or trying to build a political party, and so on? 

As an aside, my own background is in union organizing.  So I guess this is self-serving.  But, I've also discovered that my training and experience in labor organizing has allowed me to moonlight as... a management consultant!  That's right: many of the skills involved in building a union are relevant for managing a business!

One last thing: it's worth noting that some of our best business schools and management schools treat non-profit entrepreneurship and management on a par with for-profit entrepreneurship and management. 

EDIT: Sorry if this upset people.  I did not mean to do that.  And I do not think that Chow and Blumberg intend to do anything bad.  Often people have the best intentions but they miss something important.  I am trying here to suggest some important things they are missing.",gimlet,A Critical Take on StartUp

My company is hiring and I really want to share this episode with colleagues but for the life of me I can't find it. They were interviewing a guy at a small fintech startup called Penny, ~~some kind of venmo-ish app I think,~~ that had ~~like three~~ four employees and they were looking for number ~~four~~ five. The people already on the team were upper middle class ~~white~~ guys ~~from Stanford~~ and they were really focused on getting someone on the team with a different background.

There was a piece of conversation that sticks out in my mind where the host said: ""We asked Mitch: here are two hypothetical candidates, equally strong in coding and other important values at Penny, but one is a white guy and the other has a less typical background. Who would you hire?""

To which the guest replies ""You just said that they're equally qualified. What we're saying is that the people that we're interested in hiring, we're weighing them across all of these factors. So somebody with a diverse background and a totally different perspective, in our opinion, is more qualified for the position that we're trying to fill. Giving us a perspective that we've never considered helps the product more than somebody that has our same perspective but is good at engineering.""",gimlet,Looking for (what I think was) an episode of Start Up

She's wrong. The '97% myth' has been exposed several times and is junk statistics at its worst. 

NRO: Given the politics of modern academia and the scientific community, it’s not unlikely that most scientists involved in climate-related studies believe in anthropogenic global warming, and likely believe, too, that it presents a problem. However, there is no consensus approaching 97 percent. A vigorous, vocal minority exists. The science is far from settled.

I'm hoping there's a second season (Or is it just on a break part way through the first season?). I see over on the sidebar that it's on hiatus and it's to be decided when it returns. 

This is one of my key complaints actually. How hard it is to find information about the schedule and how little there is. For instance: I had no idea that the first season was ending or that it was going on hiatus until no new episodes were uploaded for a while and I saw it in the sidebar here. That's true of other shows too. There doesn't seem to be any information about it on Gimlet's official website either; for any of their shows. The only information I've ever found is on the sidebar of this sub. The same is true for when Reply All took a break for a bit around Christmas/New Years. I really wish Gimlet would be better and clearer about when shows are taking a break/the season is ending and when they'll be coming back. I also wish it was made easily available on their website either on each show's individual page or have the schedule be its own page. It'd be even better if the hosts could say something as well. 

I get that Gimlet is still growing and experimenting and sometimes shows get canceled but just having a show on indefinite hiatus and making no mention of that and having the only info I can find be a ""TBD"" on the sidebar of this subreddit seems amateur and unprofessional and is frankly frustrating. Am I missing something? Is this info on the website and I just never found it? Do the hosts say something and I just always miss it?

This is the description of the show 

""We’re going back to one of the biggest, most tumultuous and well-documented moments in American history, and turning the story on its head. (We can’t tell you which one, but we will soon.) This new show will tell the stories that were left out of the official version, the ones you won’t see in documentaries or movies. Hosted by two major talents in audio storytelling, the show will guide listeners through a series of  mind-bending, poignant, and gut-wrenching episodes about war, race, gender, spies, music, betrayal, and hot-air balloons. And it will connect these underreported moments from the past to the raucous political moment we’re living in right now.""

ShlomoTheCat,1486117660,"At the beginning, I loved Gimlet.  The origins season and Reply All in its early days both were transcendent.  Reply All still can be breathtakingly good.

But, since then - with a few exceptions (Mystery Show, early Undone and all of Crimetown), Gimlet has become light fare.  It's all fluffy and goofy, with all sorts of cheap feels.  The worst of this is Twice Removed, which sounds like a bad game show.  It makes my skin crawl as the host practically begs the guest and the listeners to care.  It's ridiculous.  Dan Savage sure seemed bored and just politely played along.  The other episodes are so cloying as to be unlistenable.

Science Vs could be excellent, but it treats the practice of science so uncritically that I want to pull my hair out.  

For a few years, I downloaded and listened to everything Gimlet produced.  I now listen to only two Gimlet podcasts: Reply All and Crimetown.  [EDIT: Also Startup - I loved this season on Charney.]

I came to realize that the whole Gimlet aesthetic is to be as non-threatening and emptily charming as possible.  They appear to work hard at avoiding producing material that assumes their audience are intelligent.  Complicated or difficult concept on a show about science?  Forget it!  Something other than a goofy story about some white person's uncomfortable interaction with another white person?  Do it!  A challenging episode acknowledging systemic injustice or complicated issues around race and identity?  Avoid! Avoid!  For example, Science Vs. doesn't even bother explaining basic concepts in statistics (how about 3 minutes on p-values?).  And after a handwringing episode about gender and race from two years ago (during which Blumberg relentlessly talked over women and people of color), there is basically nothing.

Fucking Donald Trump is our president, we are sliding into WWIII, and Gimlet media is publishing these cutesy, narcissistic audio essays by Jonathan Goldstein.  We are living in frighteningly interesting times, and they have some milquetoast game show about people's family histories?  

This is all so surprising given Blumberg's background in TAL and Planet Money.  TAL, in particular, does not shy away from truly challenging radio.  And, its best work is breathtaking - the best reporting in all of America, really.  (From Blumberg's own Giant Pool of Money to the amazing episodes on segregation in schools to those episodes in Iraq.)

So, get some guts, Gimlet, and take a risk with shows that are topical and hard-hitting.  Do some journalism, for crying out loud!  Don't be afraid of losing audience because you are challenging.  

Here's a quick suggestion: How about a biweekly podcast on political ideas with real journalism.  It can treat its listeners as smart and wanting to be informed.  Let's talk about the concept of democracy and then do a story about unique challenges faced by democracies.  (You can even teach your listeners about the Condorcet theorem!)  Something with more reporting than the Weeds, something with more adults and less facile punditry than the 538 podcast, something with more actual news than Pod Save America, something that is better produced than anything produced by the New Yorker (p.s., I listen to and respect each one of those pods).

Mtbnz,1485401786,"I don't really follow or enjoy S.A. so forgive me for being a little behind on the changes with hosts. I saw a few months ago that John Hodgman was filling in, and I assumed Adam McKay was out after he no longer needed to drum up publicity for The Big Short. But today when I was reading about the other messing around with hosts, formats and shows etc. that Gimlet has been doing (specifically this time about the cancellation of UnDone - which I was just getting into), I saw that now Rachel Ward has left the show - and apparently so did Adam Davidson?? When did that happen?

I did a search on the r/gimlet page, as well as a general google search, and couldn't find any announcement that Davidson was leaving, so can anybody fill in what happened for me?

Also, why is Gimlet even bothering to persist with the charade that this show is salvageable? It was very poorly received when it premiered, suffered through numerous personnel changes, has been put on hiatus, and now not only have the original hosts both bailed out of the entire company, but the replacement hosts have moved on too.

C'mon Gimlet, just be straight with your listeners. No, we don't own any stake of the company, so you aren't legally or morally obligated to tell us what's going on, and I don't expect full transparency about things that are private company business. But please don't treat us like we're stupid.

Any time a compelling or well produced show is released, it's almost immediately cancelled or mutilated.

- Mystery Show
- Sampler 
- Surprisingly Awesome
- Undone

All cancelled or significantly altered. And what irks me is the lack of communication. We don't get clear reasons *why* these well produced shows are being gutted. What we *do* get, however, is a seemingly endless barrage of Twice Removed spam episodes on every Gimlet podcast. Even the update letting us know signifant news about Surprisingly Awesome was just an ad for Twice Removed. Dude. Deceptive. 

Look, I know Gimlet must use a different metric for evaluating their shows than a random schmuck like me. I'm sure that gutting all these shows and using deceptive ad practices makes perfect sense to the Gimlet team, given the info and strategy they have. And that's exactly the problem. Their strategy is out of touch with me (and by proxy, a lot of similar bored, white collar workers who need content to listen to while they commute). It doesn't consider why I loved Alex /Gimlet in the first place: compelling stories and transparent communication. Aside from a few standout shows, Gimlet no longer represents those things.

Making this first season was incredible and we’ve loved seeing how the stories resonated with you. Which made this decision really hard. Undone was performing well, but the show requires a very particular kind of editorial support, and as we got into the first season, it became clear that as of right now, we don’t have everything we need for it to keep growing and experimenting and finding its way. Gimlet is a start-up. Some things we try are going to continue on for a long time. And some things won’t.

So after a lot of thought and discussion, we reached the decision to stop making the show. We’re tremendously proud of the work we’ve done this season, and overwhelmed with gratitude for all of you who have listened, posted reviews, and written to us. Thanks also to Retro Report, the documentary film series we worked with on coming up with the idea for the show; to Gimlet; and to our fantastic team.

I've seen a few threads in this sub turn into recommendations for other podcasts, which is great, but generally someone will list a bunch, then people will comment on how great they are, then someone else will list some of the same and some different ones. All well and good, but I had an idea for a different thread that may let the crowd favorites rise to the top.

Here's my idea: In this thread the **parent comment has to be just the name of one podcast** you recommend, no editorializing. Then people can upvote the ones they also recommend. If want to explain what it's about, you can make that a comment or if you really like one or have something to say you can comment. This could give us a sense of which ones lots of people here like and also be a thread for suggestions. Plus I think it could be fun (or who knows, this might not work at all).

I'll start with some suggestions and we can see how it goes!

kylerk,1481994658,"I really like what Gimlet does and am a long time fan. This thought just came to mind that Gimlet may be hurting itself long term by constantly advertising the same few brands.

I'm talking Square space, Audible and Blue Apron. 

My reasoning is that podcasts are interesting to listen to because they usually provide new and interesting things to hear. Unfortunately something like 10%-20% of every show is just an ad for the exact same services.

Sure they are pretty creative with how they promote those brands, but my mind still shuts down and I often reach for the skip button. 

If they could actually insentivise new brands, products and services to advertise, the shows would actually be more listenable. 

Just imagine how much more terrible TV would be if there was only 3 types of ads that ever aired.

I'm sure this is a hard problem to solve, but that is literally the point of Startups. They solve hard problems.

JCRNYC,1481824946,"I must say, I am really enjoying this show. Well produced, engaging, interesting.

My question then, is:  How many of you are struggling to understand the direction this show will take or what it is thematically about?

I say this because when I first heard the preview a few weeks ago, I had a hard time figuring out what this show would be.  As I understood it, it would be ""the untold stories behind big news stories.""  The first episode blew me away - I remembered seeing video clips of that record burning, and it explained the cultural context of the one, contained moment very well and how it bled into peoples lives.  The next three episodes were all great and entertaining, but I had trouble picking out the one moment/news event that captivated the collective culture.  I'm thinking something like the Waco standoff, the OJ chase, the killing of Tupac/Biggie, 9/11, The moon landing, Heaven's gate cult...Things that are specific, poignant news moments from back in the day when TV would get interrupted and you knew something was ""big"".

I'm not saying that this is the direction the show should take, but I thought it would be tied more to those specific, crystal clear moments (like the image of the burning records and ""Disco Sucks"" banner the crowd was waving has become part of our collective consciousness). The teaser promoted that one of the episodes would be about 9/11, (the Ibrahim episode), but it seems only tangentially related - as in the entire culture shifted because of the event, but it's not really ABOUT the event.  Same with the online dating episode.  It was interesting, but there was not a real MOMENT, just a cultural shift.

I'm not complaining about the quality AT ALL and I love it, I'm more interested in hearing thoughts about shows that are a bit ""muddy"".  I.e., I hope this doesn't turn into another Surprisingly Awesome (a good show that could be basically about anything.)",gimlet,Thoughts on Undone?

boss1000,1481145699,"In a discussion about the latest season of *StartUp* and the controversy over the subject of Dov Charney, I was told by /u/Replyallalex that [the encounter at the bank in the first episode of the arc was genuine](https://www.reddit.com/r/gimlet/comments/5gob7d/heres_what_i_wrote_to_gimlet_about_start_ups/dau1r1p/). I'm not sure how much of his statement is opinion or based on inside knowledge we don't have, but this surprised me!

I completely believed Charney when he was asked if that was a plant ([tail end of the conversation and Chow's perspective](https://soundcloud.com/hearstartup/part-1-labels-season-4-episode-6#t=13:00)). His answer occupied the same kind of vaguery that he seemed to rely on in the most recent episode with his solicitation of the very reporters interviewing him. It was a ""joking"" yes, which to me gives the air of plausible deniability: if ever pressed, he can say he was being silly *or* completely admitted to it! Same with back at his home: he's ""just kidding"" until someone takes him up on it.

Anyway, that's my perspective. I'm really curious how others came away from that moment those few weeks ago. This isn't just a dissection of a FedEx encounter, either. It seems to be a recurring trait of his that's worth exploring.",gimlet,[StartUp] Did you believe the FedEx encounter in S4E4 was genuine?

pbear737,1480970055,"I had been sitting on some mixed feelings about their choice to focus on Dov Charney since it was announced. I decided after this last episode to do something about it. Here's what I sent to them today:

To Whom it May Concern:

As a devoted Gimlet listener who is subscribed to more than half of your line-up, I was nervous upon hearing the subject of the newest season of Start Up. I decided I would come in with an open mind and give it a shot when I heard that Dov Charney's indiscretions would be addressed within the show. 

I have come to the conclusion that this podcast serves as little more than a platform to legitimize someone who clearly has abused his power and repeatedly objectified countless women. The first several episodes of a relatively short season didn't directly address the various allegations against him at all. They were repeatedly referred to opaquely as ""the controversy surrounding Dov Charney"". Calling the horrific claims against him simply ""controversy"" minimizes the harm of his actions to a level I find shameful.Then when allegations were finally addressed, they were done so in a way that to me framed the entire situation as something up for discussion still on its integrity and morality. That would be a ridiculous assertion given the vast, diverse, and documented claims against him. 

And let's just say you don't care about what this softball portrayal of Charney does to buoy a seemingly unrepentant serial predator, the season doesn't even live up to what Start Up is supposed to be. The audience only knows basic aspects of this new business. Where is he getting the money? When does he pitch to investors? Is equity all his? Will there be any changes to how he operates with women in his new company? We don't know any of that at more than a superficial level.

As someone who works with victims of sexual violence, I hope that Start Up staff reflect on whether this portrayal has contributed to the tacit acceptance of violence against women that pervades so much of our media. We may come to different conclusions, but I think considering the impact of the show is worthy of their time.

I know that I am not alone in this perspective. I plan to unsubscribe to Start Up for the remainder of the season though I will look to see how Gimlet Media responds to their audience feedback.

Thank you for your reflective consideration.

Sincerely,

mi-16evil,1479344044,"&gt;There was more than just my parent's disapproval [of me becoming a rabbi] at play. Something else was taking shape too. At first learning I have an everlasting soul was great, but because of who I am, my fear of death evolved into a new fear. A fear of going on forever. Going on and on, past boredom, past nausea, through millennia upon millennia and never being able to turn my brain off. That somehow felt worse than death.  

&gt;God or no god, messiah or no messiah, it started to feel like maybe it all didn't matter anyway. I might not die but I'd always be me. Awkward, teenage, acned me. As that fear grew I decided one night to go see Rabbi Neu(sp). I was desperate to believe, desperate to just be a normal person like everybody else. Maybe if I was honest about my most secret anxious thoughts, if I just put them out there, he might be able to help assuage them. At his house I laid it all out and in the ensuing silence I remember Rabbi Neu saying that this wasn't a good way to think. 

&gt;I walked home that night looking up at the stars, but rather feeling cozy and warm as I used to, assured of my place in the universe, I felt the horror of all that going on and on forever. I was unable to make my peace with it and I no longer felt that Judaism had the answers. 

&gt;Trying to will myself to believe was as futile as willing myself to fall in love. I was left feeling that if there was a god, he was too big to know with my small brain. Too inhuman to know with my human heart.

I should preface this by saying I didn't think that the previous site was that great but looking at this new one, oof. Let me just bullet point a few issues right off the bat.

* On the homepage you can't see if there's a new episode for any of the podcasts without clicking on their pages directly
* The arrows on the header don't scroll through other headers, it takes you to the current header on display page
* The various images/logos for the shows clash with one another with out proper borders
* Inconsistent capitalization (possibly intentional and also just a nit pick)
* The ""Shows"" drop down menu is inconsistent to use 
* Can not navigate the sight while listening to the player on the page (unlike a website like 99 Percent Invisible's)
* The blurbs of ""Listener's favorites"" and ""Latest from Gimlet"" don't match the background (intentional?)
* Some links (like on the [About](https://gimletmedia.com/about/) page aren't actually links, just text.

On a personal preference note I find the single font they use for all text on the main page looks really jarring when everything is written in it. But my biggest complaint is how you can't just visit the main page and see what's been updated with the latest episode shown. What do you think?

StripWeathers,1478980031,"I don't think I'm alone in thinking that SA is Gimlet's worst podcast. I didn't make this post to hate on it; I made it to point out some things I think Gimlet could do to *save* it, because I think it has potential. It's wildly inconsistent, but it does have it's highs (broccoli, extinct hockey, pigeons). Unfortunately, for every high there is a low (yoga, crying).

These are my **opinions** about some things Gimlet could do to re-invent the podcast —

* I think it would benefit from re-inventing itself as a 99pi clone. By that I mean, it's focus should shift from taking something boring and making it interesting, to taking something *mundane or relatively unknown* and making it interesting (which is essentially what 99pi is). Extinct Hockey is by far the best episode which I know because it had a title that intrigued me, which leads to my next point...
* As a listener, I'm much more likely to click on ""Extinct Hockey"" than ""Broccoli."" I listen to podcasts to liven up boring things. Although I know the point is to make these things interesting, I find it hard to choose to listen to an episode called ""Crying"" or ""Flossing"" when there are so many more interesting-*sounding* podcasts in my queue these days. It'd be one thing if SA delivered on its premise every episode, but it doesn't. For every pigeons episode, there's a yoga episode. The titles don't have to be click-bait, they just need to be something I'm not hardwired to find uninteresting.
* Lastly, I know this has been beaten to death, but it would also benefit from a consistent host. I don't care so much who it is, but I think the way to go here is to hire someone full-time to host the show, rather than using someone part-time (the Adams) or pulling Rachel away from her other role (though I think Rachel is great when she does host).

I recently had someone tell me the moby CD-borrowing story as if it was fact, and when I told him it was from a fictional podcast (Heavyweight) he was shocked as he had no inclination of that.

skyzm_,1477325702,"Couldn't find any previous posts on the subject, wanted to get some thoughts.

So if I could take a stab at what Gimlet's credo is, I'd say: Creating the best, highly produced narrative podcasts in the world.

Gimlet's shows are all super high quality stories that are an absolute delight to listen to. My main problem as a listener is that I've torn through every episode of every Gimlet podcast. Blumberg, Lieber, and crew have created an amazing little universe that I trust.

I'd love to see a daily show. It'd be the opposite of the shows they set out to make - more of the ""some people in a room with a mic"" feel that Alex has mentioned before. This doesn't have to be a bad thing though. 

You wouldn't need the type of journalists that work on the other shows. You'd just want good, funny hosts. Imagine a daily show with the likes of (for example) Adam McKay and Adam Davidson talking about the previous day's news and events. Keeping it light with fun commentary. Responding to listener voice memos. Developing segments like Yes Yes No that you could hear a couple times a week. And you can still cheat the ""feel"" of the production with simple music stingers and segment intros.

And, more importantly, Gimlet would be staying in their listeners heads.

The three month Surprisingly Awesome break hurts, and the other shows get delayed sometimes due to the nature of developing a story. I know there are tons of great podcasts out there, but I'm invested in Gimlet. I'd love to know that everyday there's going to be that 25 minute hit on my way in to work.

Maybe in four years Gimlet will have enough shows to satisfy people like me. And I bet the idea that they don't create enough content is horrifying for them, considering what's involved in making what they do now. What do you guys think?

Edit: I regret saying ""cheat the feel of production"". Their audio folks and producers are pros. No cheating required.",gimlet,I'd love to see a daily Gimlet podcast

YoureGratefulDead2Me,1477173127,"[First Reply all did a four-part series on a convicted murderer called *On the Inside*.](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/64-on-the-inside/) Sure, it was a happy accident that this particular case had so many necessary details, quality interviews, and intrigue to warrant a four-parter. Sruthi seems to have more-or-less stumbled upon a complex fascinating case, but the results were absolutely amazing.


[Then Science Vs goes into a ](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/9-forensic-science/)[2-part (or more?) series on forensic science.](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/10-dna-and-the-scent-of-death/) In the latter of the episodes Wendy even goes into some detail about a case involving the scent of a child's dead body being traced by canine police dog to the trunk of her mother's car. Another about DNA evidence on a knife and a bra clasp at the scene of a stabbing. These details were not necessary to the show, but they were included to give the episode a gritty true crime edge. Personally, this is one of my favorite Science Vs episodes to date. 


[And lastly, Sampler's farewell episode focuses specifically on True Crime podcasts.](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/31-true-crime/) The host Brittany expresses discomfort with the whole genre throughout the show. It quite clearly was *not* her choice to do a true crime episode. Simply searching ""True crime"" on many podcast apps will now bring up this episode and I wonder how closely Gimlet is watching the download rate for Sampler's farewell show.


The loss of the Mystery Show may also figure into this. While not true crime, it had the sleuthing and suspense that is common in whodunnit style true crime. So with 6 new shows being launched (or is it 5 since Heavyweight is already out?) is it possible Gimlet is launching a show in the True Crime genre? ",gimlet,Is Gimlet testing the True Crime waters?

listener01,1475880376,"I just listened to the new StartUp episode and was soooo disappointed they dismissed the idea of a DOD podcast so quickly and with so little deliberation.  They basically seemed to say ""what if some people don't like it?"" and ""what kinds of episodes would we do?"" To the first point, your listenership is falling off, obviously not everyone is going to like everything you're doing.  And to the second point, maybe do some research and brainstorming before just dismissing?!  

I'm posting this here in case Gimlet follows this subreddit, and curious what others think.  Personally, I think it could have been a great podcast, and more in line with what I think Gimlet does best - deep exploration of a specific theme.  I find the other shows a bit more random and with not enough depth for my taste, though of course we all have different preferences.  

I love StartUp and Reply All, and enjoyed Open for Business, but when they discussed the drop in listeners for the rest of their shows I was thinking ""yep, makes sense to me, I'm in the group that stopped listening to the rest.""  Obviously their shows are going to appeal to different people in different ways, but would love to see them branch out with something like this and think they missed a real opportunity to explore a topic that impacts so many of us in so many ways but we rarely get beyond tropes of the DOD and military.  And wasn't all their hemming and hawing about branded podcasts resolved by reserving journalistic control anyway?

c17r,1475698738,"Loved this show in the very beginning.  I guess I was one of the few who liked the concept of one host having to convince the other that something was awesome.  Like the Concrete episode, where halfway through you weren't sure if Davidson was going to be able to convince McKay but he pulled it out in the end.  But I could deal with the change to mostly tag-teaming on something being Surprisingly Awesome.

But I feel like the show has gone down hill since Extinct Hockey:

- Follow-ups: not much to really comment here, felt like a filler.
- Flossing: meh, just tidbits and history of flossing and flossing habits.  Never really popped.
- Yoga: again, tidbits and history.  And it was real disappointing since Davidson is usually the one who gets so engaged to explain the awesome-ness of something (c.f. Concrete Episode)
- Cardboard: guh.  I love me some John Hodgman but felt like half the episode was box/crate jokes and puns.  Trying hard to be funny, they forgot the purpose of the show!
- Crying: this was a train wreck.  First episode that I really had to put my shoulder into to finish.  Did we determine that *anything* was awesome in this episode? No, just that Tim can't cry.
- Postal Addresses: Again, how/where were we convinced that postal codes were awesome? Instead we were shown several various post addresses but closed with ""meh, not needed ... people learn to work around"".  So...they're **not** actually awesome is the conclusion, I guess?
- Wedding Planning: Again, trivia/tidbits.  In fact, most of the episode was about how stressful and financial sink hole wedding planning is.  So it's awesome that the more you spend on your wedding the higher your chance of divorce? And that the wedding industry has a vested interest in using the higher average cost instead of the mode cost?

It just feels like the whole premise of the show is changing.  It's no longer `Surprisingly Awesome` but `Huh, That's Interesting` or `Fun Facts with Rachel and Guest`, both of which might be good shows but not what I'm here for.

ElCobraLazerFace,1472185100,"After hearing the new plug for Gimlet Membership on this week's Reply All I could not help but feel put off by the ""bonuses"" that Gimlet offers to members. I do not object to the subscription idea in itself as I am subscribed to multiple Twitch accounts (which is 5 bucks per month) and am a sustaining member of my local Public Radio station. The reason that Gimlet Membership seems iffy to me is that it charges you for something that should already be free: transparency and communication. 

Now what do I mean by that? What I'm saying is that the most direct channel of communication to Gimlet shouldn't require a Subscription. Yeah, there are the various Twitter accounts, newsletters, emails, and this very Reddit but those forms of contact frequently feel like shouting into a void. Which feels very wrong for a supposedly [open business](http://digiday.com/publishers/gimlet-hopes-win-podcasting-arms-race). If Gimlet really wants to be open and receive feedback beyond 140 characters they shouldn't put a pay wall in front of their most direct form of communication.

So what should they do? Well, I don't know but I do have some ideas. First off on the Social Media front. Gimlet needs to be more proactive on social media. Less retweets of people saying ""good job"". More ""hey, this week there will be no new episode of Reply All"" or ""Just a heads up this weeks episode of Science Versus is slated to be released by Tuesday"" or ""Oops, we missed our Tuesday Deadline, new ep on Thursday"". Something that will show people that content is being worked on. It would make Gimlet look less like a slumbering giant that occasionally releases a show and more like the incredibly active company that it is. As for ways to receive feedback without a pay wall perhaps a Gimlet forum, not just a fan reddit or a slack channel, but an actually fully committed forum online for Gimlet that anyone can join. These are just a couple ideas. They're not monuments or anything and I would really like to hear what you others think.

The whole reason I've written this is because I've been with Gimlet since Start Up episode 1 (technically even before that) and what I heard was something amazing. A company that was open about what they did. Maybe this gave me the false sense of hope that maybe there would be a web based company that gets transparency and interaction with their audience right. Which is why I tried personally to give feedback and was usually left with vague answers and coy remarks. So please let me know your personal experiences and opinions.

EDIT: Just to clarify, I was referring to episode #18 of Reply All, in which they discuss Lindsey Stone, a woman who was the subject of a massive internet shitstorm (lost her job, etc) after she posted a picture of her pretending to yell in front of a ""Silence and Respect"" sign at Arlington National Cemetery on Facebook. A service called reputation.com helped her recover from this by creating all sorts of good content on the internet to show up when her name is searched, and apparently at the time of the podcast searching her name still turned up a decent amount of good stuff. I heard the podcast today and tried searching her name - was surprised to see that reputation.com's work (supposedly valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars) is completely missing from the front page.",gimlet,"Just listened to #18 ""Silence and Respect"", and reputation.com's work doesn't seem to have lasted."

dontthrowmeinabox,1470501638,"Hello,

As the number of podcasts from Gimlet has ballooned, I've found it harder to keep track of the threads for new episodes.  It used to be easy when there was 1-3 a week and the stickied one would just shift accordingly, but it's been getting trickier.

So, my suggestion is this:

Each week, we have a new episode megathread that gets stickied.  It then is updated to include links to the new episodes that have come out in a given week (or perhaps their threads).  The new episodes can then be discussed in the sub-threads.",gimlet,Suggestion for new podcast releases
glass_hedgehog,1470487267,"I got an email last week telling me the date and time of a live call-in Reply All via live YouTube stream on Monday. It said not to share the info on social media, but the event has passed and I'm curious to hear if anyone else here was invited.

As far as I can tell, they invited a few hundred random people. At most I think there were only ever about 300 people watching the stream. I know they said there would be another one on Thursday, but I didn't get an email inviting me to that one with a link. Unless they happen to do one of these on another sick day, I probably won't get to participate again since it was held during the work day, so who knows how many people they actually invited. 

It was kind of a shit show, but it was fascinating. They had so many technical difficulties, and PJ kept laughing at Alex while he tried to fix it. Honestly I came away with the impression that Sruthi might be the only person who knows what she's doing. It took probably 30-45 minutes to resolve the technical difficulties well enough for the boys to start taking phone calls. 

People called in with their hard decisions. One girl was agonizing over which college to attend, and PJ told her about the terrible college decision he made. Another guy wanted help with a girlfriend problem. Someone else was thinking about quitting his job to pursue podcasting. Someone else wanted to know if they should come out as transgender to their family. I think there were a few other calls in there. 

There was no mention about whether this would make it onto the podcast or not. For some reason it is supposed to be super secret, but I decided to share it with you as long as I didn't give away times or dates or links to the next one (which I don't know anyway). 

For the record, I'm not a Gimlet member, so I'm really unsure why I was invited. ",gimlet,Was anyone else involved with the live Reply All call-in show?

xLNBx,1469914402,,gimlet,Alex Goldman on What's Tech?
thirdmango,1469904202,"So this is a strange question, and I feel like it's the kind of thing that may only be happening to me. So I have an iphone 5 and it's not upgraded to the current OS, it's the one that was before the current one. (8? Instead of 9? I don't keep up on that stuff as much because if I do upgrade it, I won't be able to connect it to my computer which is old.) 

Anyways, I've been an avid listener of reply all and they did an episode that featured the podcast sampler. I liked it so I downloaded an episode and something strange started happening, the image when I would try to load a podcast would take a while to fall into place and then while listening to the episode my iphone would temporarily shut off, go back to the black screen with the apple logo and turn right back on again. It became annoying and it kept happening but I figured it was only happening with sampler so I just don't listen to sampler. Well then this week the episode has the science vs. on frakking and I wanted to listen to that. Well what do you know, this episode is making my iphone temporarily shut off. 

Now I don't know if it has to do with the image but what exactly happens is when it comes to now just sampler and science vs (and this doesn't happen with the nearly 40 other podcasts from all different companies I listen to) when you click on a downloaded episode it does this swipe thing, where it swipes the episode in. With all other shows (including reply all) it swipes in smooth. With sampler and science vs. it takes a bit to load and then it clunky-shifts in. And then again while I'm randomly listening to the episode or usually when I pause the episode my iphone temp shuts down and then back on. 

I'm not very technologically experienced. On every yes yes no I'm always on the no side, so I'm basically an old person trying to figure out this new phone box. But I figure especially since it's happening with just gimlet podcasts and they do like tech support randomness questions that someone here might know what the heck is happening to me. 

Thanks.   ",gimlet,Strange iphone question in regards to gimlet podcasts

klebstift,1467928267,"My name is Christine Driscoll and I’m producer for a podcast called Surprisingly Awesome, hosted by Adam McKay (The Big Short, Anchorman) and Adam Davidson (NPR, NYT) at Gimlet Media. Our show is about the things in everyday life that seem mundane at first but are actually... surprisingly awesome.

And we’re planning an episode about weddings! We're interested in looking at the choices that go into weddings - and the stories that play out off stage. For example, Why is no one giving the bride away? Why are there three flower girls? Why is there communion AND a chuppah?

We recognize that for the couple, the wedding is awesome, but to the average guest, most weddings feel the same. So: We'd like to attend a traditional wedding and record a 360 immersive documentary podcast about it and we’re looking for a couple who would like to go on this journey with us.

And to address one big element of this, yes -- our show is about things that seem boring at first, and I think this is a subreddit full of smart people who recognizes that though their wedding is an important day in their lives, for most of the population (and maybe even themselves at some point), it’s a different experience. We’d love to be connected with couples that are game to participate, and who have a sense of humor about the process.
