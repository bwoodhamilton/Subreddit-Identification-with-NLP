ImmortalBluePenguin,"After an MRI of my brain, an ER doctor immediately guessed that I get migraines from all the white matter lesions. Somehow it felt good to know that I can point to at least one objective thing to make my migraines real to other people: they literally kill brain tissue in an observable way. 

(Thankfully, doctors believe the lesions causes by migraine don't cause issues: https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/migraine-and-brain-lesions/)

As a kid in elementary school, my migraines came on slowly.  During the early stages, I'd try to convince myself nothing was happening.   When the pain really kicked in, I'd hunker down mentally, reduce my focus to one narrow thing at a time, and power through the day, until I could get home and collapse into bed with a puke bucket and a wet washcloth.

I still remember vividly how good it felt to wake up the next day exhausted, but pain free.  (Soon coupled, at times with the horrible, sinking feeling that another attack was coming on.)

I got on sumatriptan in high school, and it changed my life.  It actually felt like I had some control over my own life.  

I've done a bunch of stuff to try to treat and prevent my migraines since discovering sumatriptan -- depakote, nortriptyline, spg nerve block, TMS, Botox, marijuana, opiates,IV heroin etc -- but nothing had the life-changing impact of sumatriptan until ajovy a few months ago.  

If you get migraines, get yourself to your nuerologist and get on one of the anti-cgrp meds!  Ajovy at least doesn't prevent them, but it knocks the pain down 80% or more with one monthly injection. Truly life-changing.

JesseThorn,"In my (admittedly anecdotal) experience, there are many, many more people who do not seek help for migraine or who are stymied by bad doctors than there are people who seek help and do not get at least some significant alleviation of symptoms. Very few cases of migraines are “cured.” Mine certainly aren’t; I meet the standard for “severely disabled” according to the paperwork I did this morning. 

Those of us who have lived with this condition for decades, who have tried dozens of treatments, who’ve dramatically altered our lifestyles to accommodate our condition and our disability, are generally still glad for the relief modern medication offers, even if it’s partial. And glad that some people get closer to total relief.

I didn’t graduate from middle school and barely graduated from high school. I’m affected by pain about five days a week. This condition gets between me and my work and family constantly. I understand the stakes.

The good news is that the triptans are now generic and are highly effective for something like 85% of sufferers. For most of the remaining portion other abortive like ergotamine, nsaids and caffeine are at least somewhat effective. 

I would never minimize the problems of those for whom modern medicine isn’t enough, not least because K am one of those people. But with migraine, underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis are much bigger and much easier to solve problems.

(And yes, that underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis is in part due to misogyny, whether because invisible diseases are not taken seriously particularly from female patients, because it is largely a female disease, because it is tied to reproductive and hormonal cycles for many women, because women are taught that they deserve to suffer silently,  or because men are afraid to pursue treatment for a lady disease they got from their mom.)",1562816538,maximumfun

neurobeegirl,"I'm sorry you feel that way. My personal impression (as someone with friends for whom triptans not only did not work, but actually caused dangerous side effects) is that he was trying to offer support to people who had been inadequately served by the health care system, not trying to suggest anyone can be ""cured."" In fact, although it sounds like a combination of medications helped him a lot, it also sounded like he was saying, and has said before, that he is able to better manage his headaches, not that he is cured or no longer experiences them.

I'm so sorry your friend hasn't found something that helps her manage her pain and I'm glad if she hasn't experienced misogyny or other prejudice while consulting with professionals. But I personally have experienced being told by doctors that I should just ""be less stressed"" to avoid headaches or other conditions, so to me the encouragement to those who have heard something like this to seek better care was warranted, and not meant to exclude those for whom existing treatments do not work.

Finally, I wonder if there is any way that your friend could gain access to this new medication: https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/cgrp-new-era-migraine-treatment-2018030513315",1562810986,maximumfun

neurobeegirl,"As a fellow migraine sufferer, I really appreciated the headache discussion. I also definitely suggest a pill case and as a parent/friend of other parents, I kind of recommend a child-proof one. If you don't want to specifically buy something like that, you can buy a pocket-sized vial of name-brand meds and then keep a mixed pill collection in there once it's empty.

Maybe I'm paranoid and I know the odds are low, but even if I weren't around little kids and pets, I would worry about keeping loose pocket pills. If one falls out on the street and a dog or a toddler snarfs it up, it could be incredibly harmful or even fatal.

There are two very different kinds of roaches that one might encounter here— the German cockroach and the palmetto bug, and you have to handle them differently.

The German cockroaches are definitely attracted to food, and are the “if you see 1 they are a 100 you don’t see,” probably hiding in the walls. These need poison, spraying, and tidiness. 

The palmetto bugs are huge, and fly, and live in trees. They come into your house when it gets hot out because they are looking for water. So keeping tidy isn’t going to fix them. Instead, you try to seal up as many cracks as you can. Put spray foam around all the plumbing gaps in your walls. Check your doors and windows to make sure they’re sealed. If you see any daylight around your door, redo the weatherstripping. Etc. 

But if you don’t even know what kind of roach you’ve got, you can’t even start to deal with them properly. /rant",1562203930,maximumfun

You have some kids who see this as merely a game from grandma. That's, of course, how they should see it, it's all there is to it. You have a mother and a grandmother with a healthy attitude toward it. You have a father who has a weird, baseless doubt that he's pretty much too embarrassed to openly admit, that maybe there's real spooks or demons on some ethereal plane of evil being contacted by this Parker Brothers' toy.

The correct ruling: tell the kids to enjoy, that it's just a game. Let the mother and the grandmother explain that some people have superstitious views of the game, but that it's really just the players moving the planchette. 

Instead, the learned and usually right fake internet judge decided that the paranoid, superstitious parent should be the one to guide the kids. He's to instill his spiritualistic fear into these unsuspecting tykes, making them think their grandmother has exposed them to the realms of Hell.

Let's say that instead of an arts high school in San Francisco, Jesse Thorn had gone to that science high school Spider-Man goes to, and then proceeded to get a PhD in biostatistics, so he 100% knew that only a few of the pills this company sells are medically necessary for just a few people, and the rest of them are just expensive food coloring for your pee.

Then an especially health conscious person who heard the ad might make a post saying, ""Hey, that's not a great brand to advertise on your network! I mean, it's not poison like, say, a Totino's pizza roll, but I think you know it's still not a good use for people's money."" Then they might explain their reasons to try to make a convincing argument. That's constructive criticism aimed at a thing you care about.

PeculiarLeah,"This was a really fantastic history episode! I'm actually a scholar in Holocaust studies so I've been following the broader crisis very closely as well as the semantic debate. So for some background the Nazis set up concentration camps as early as 1933, these had worse conditions even at the beginning than any American concentration camps, though they were significantly more comparable. particularly to the camps on the border today. In a lot of ways American concentration camps used to detain Japanese Americans, were more comparable to the conditions of DP camps set up by the Allies to house Holocaust survivors after liberation. But this doesn't mean that they were good. Survivors felt trapped in these camps, and in a lot of ways they were, the experience of DP camps is part of why there was such a high level of illegal immigration to British Mandate Palestine (what is now Israel) from 1945-1948. Many of these DP camps were actually set up in former concentration camps, and even though the Allies were trying to help (unlike in American concentration camps) people were still detained. 

Another problem is that Americans as a whole aren't really that well educated about the different kinds of camps run by the Nazis, so they automatically associate concentration camp with death camps, and in that underestimate the horror of both. Historians define several different types of camps: concentration camps, labor camps, ghettos, and extermination (death) camps. There's overlap and messiness in these definitions. Concentration camps were built in 1933, but many would also be using forced labor by 1935, and by 1945 a few had small gas chambers, which we usually only discuss in the context of death camps. 

Its kind of a catch 22 because the correct word in the case of American detention centers is probably concentration camps. However, the Holocaust and the Nazi period in general was so extreme that even using the same term seems extreme, but not using that term undermines the work that needs to be done now. The comparisons don't work, the Nazi camps were just too extreme, even in 1933, but there isn't another word that really works. 

I'd definitely suggest reading Timothy Snyder's ""On Tyranny"" for some historical context of how to resist. To me the biggest thing when it comes to these camps is that you cannot treat this as normal. Part of that is treating these as concentration camps. What do we do with concentration camps?

We liberate them. Without permission. Because they are always inhuman.",1561287335,maximumfun

baltinerdist,"I appreciate your willingness to defend your pay practices, but positioning this as a living wage in Los Angeles where the average one-bedroom rent is just under $2,500 is simply disingenuous.

https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-los-angeles-rent-trends/

If you had positioned this as ""We know this isn't a high salary, but it is the best we can do on our non-profit budget, so we know this position might not be a good fit for everyone,"" that would have been a lot more defensible.

It's okay that MaxFun isn't giving out six figure salaries. We all know that your balance sheet lives and dies on the donors and a smidgen of food box, mattress, webhost, and job search and revenue. We are totally, entirely okay with that. And we would likely be totally, entirely okay with you just coming out and saying ""We literally cannot afford to pay people more than we do.""

But it rings hollow to claim that a salary that gives you maybe fifty bucks after taxes to pay for food, utilities, transportation, insurance, and so forth is a living wage.",1560990771,maximumfun

As far as our general rate of pay, all our employees receive a living wage and generous benefits. Our rates of pay aren’t always the highest, but they’re fair and competitive, particularly co soldering the fact that much of our work is oriented toward public service rather than maximizing revenue. This job, for example, is part of a pretty large outlay that will be great for folks who want to access our shows and otherwise wouldn’t be able to, but is unlikely to generate much revenue.",1560989100,maximumfun

Currymango,"""Round Springfield"" is the 22nd episode of the Simpsons' sixth season, and this was one of the episodes ran by Al Jean and Mike Reiss. After Bart eats a jagged Metal O in Krusty's cereal and gets sent to the hospital, Lisa finds out that her mentor, Bleeding Gums Murphy, is dying. When he finally passes away, Lisa is on a mission to make the world remember the saxophonist. I find it an okay episode with great jokes, but the main plot leaves much to be desired as it is quite tropey. Ron Taylor returns as Murphy, and GreatestGen viewers best know him as the Klingon Chef (who isn't on the show anymore either!)

That a dog walker places bagged waste in the ""nearest available trash can"" indicates that the bag has certain noxious or undesirable qualities. There's a bit of gall involved in believing that other homeowners are perfectly fine with it being placed in their property.

Take that literal shit home and put it in your own trash! People generally do their daily dog walks within a couple blocks of their own homes; it doesn't seem like a big imposition to carry away the waste for a short distance. 

I suppose I'm fortunate to live in a community that doesn't allow trash cans (all garbage is bagged). Dog waste is also prohibited in public trash cans, although that is widely ignored.

I'd say, if you don't live somewhere with municipal cans or it's really not convenient to bring it back home then knock on a door and ask a neighbor if you can use their trash. It allows them to make the decision if they want poop in there and makes sure they know poop is in there so they can use the can accordingly (i.e. prepared for smells, be extra careful with heavy bags and liquids, make sure it doesn't slide down to the bottom). A neighbor with a dog will likely be very understanding and perhaps you can be their drop off can when they are in your neck of the woods.

First, big fan of the show! 

Second, never thought I’d have such passionate feelings about this. Now that people are putting their dog poop in our trash can, I need to chime in. The stench when it’s been in the sun for several days is enough to make you pass out. Even when bagged. Sorry, Jesse. :) And the fact that it’s unexpected makes it so much worse. We currently have no pets so feel it’s reasonable to expect that our garbage can won’t smell like poop when we don’t put any in there ourselves. 

It comes down to this: If the homeowner/occupant were there watching you, would you still put your dog’s poop in their garbage bin? The non-monster answer is no. It’s an imposition, whether they are there to witness it or not. Simple as. 

One solution would be a drawstring bag that attaches to the top of your dog’s leash that can contain the biodegradable bag with the poop until you get home to put it into your trash. You don’t have to carry it and it goes with you. Win/win!",1559856056,maximumfun

I live in rural suburbs, so cans are either in the garage or right up next to the garage. If I wanted to put my dog's poop in their can, I'd have to walk up their driveway, open the lid, and dump in the bag.

On garbage day, the cans are all at the end of the driveways, of course. My thought is that if it's before the trash collectors come through, it's fine to add the bag o'poop since it's going to be collected soon anyway. But if the can is empty, no dice.",1559836478,maximumfun

Of course all of humanity is descendant from Africans so there is a point back in history where every person alive was a direct ancestor or their linage died off..

I was able to train myself to relax and overcome the agoraphobia and the panic disorder that came after. It helped that the symptoms started the lessen due to the physical injury healing as time progressed. 

I’m a mental health therapist and have briefly had anxiety a couple of times before. This was quite a lot more intense. In retrospect there were many parts of the experience that I see as gifts, like being better able to empathize with others and seeing what a huge impact it had on my emotional and social resources. It’s changed the way I approach planning for the possibility that I may need physical or emotional help or support on short notice when I’m vulnerable. 

I understand what you mean about being triggered. Probably the most growth I experienced was in setting boundaries with people. There was no room for foolishness because I was in acute distress (also had cluster headaches for about 6 months and increase blood pressure/anxiety would bring them on). I got pretty aggressive about people triggering me. Agoraphobia wasn’t an option I wanted to turn to and asking others to be considerate seemed reasonable so if they weren’t I removed one of us from the space we were sharing (me or them, situation depending). Some of those relationships took damage. One person said to me “at least you weren’t faking it” when they saw I had gotten better and could discern a difference they would validate.

You are capable of so much, having coped with it as you have.  Consider kicking harmful behavior out of you space, too! When you share a vulnerability with someone and they exploit it, that’s a major red flag. It thickened my skin and got me back on my feet much faster.",1559356396,maximumfun

Did some back of the envelope out of curiosity and if you assume 2% and for simplicity's sake making a few fudgy assumptions*, the odds that biological parentage doesn't match the record becomes:

6% at the grandparent level
13% at the great grandparent level

Especially because I'd wager a guess that the promotional hats in question were probably purchased by the defendant long before MAGA existed.

That all said... If Red Hat is going to make promotional hats, they should really be fedoras like the one in their logo. And wearing the existing hats around may be in poor taste.

In talking to people about about it, after I forced them to watch this movie, it seemed like you could come to different conclusions about the extent to which the real-life dad might be the 'ghost in the machine' that animates Baker Dill. I don't really buy that, but really it probably makes as much sense as any other interpretation of the movie.

Because you eventually get to trying to figure out stuff like, OK, so the scene where Karen (Anne Hathaway's character) is reminiscing about that time she had sex with Baker Dill on a bridge after he told her ""you're old enough now"". Why is this in the game? I feel like the basic possibilities are:

- This is something Karen told her thirteen-year-old-son about, and he put it in the game.
- This is something the son made up to for his parents (or their stand-ins) to talk about in the game.
- The son didn't explicitly put it in the game, but the game is influenced by things that Karen and Dill know (or knew) in real life.

jwghaller,"Regarding the question of whether the BIG TWIST was dumb or not, I felt like it didn't really work, for two reasons.

One is that then it made you think about the rest of the movie and try to figure out if it made sense in the context of 'a troubled thirteen-year-old put this in a video game'. As noted in the episode, the revelation comes literally minutes after the video game's version of the kid's father has awkward, angry boat sex with the video game's version of the kid's mother. What does any of it mean?

But the other problem, which was the bigger one for me, was that once I knew everyone I've seen is a character in a video game, and that somewhere else in the (movie's version of the) real world there are things going on with actual stakes, then it was hard for me to care about anything that happened. I didn't care about what happened inside the video game, because none of it was real, and very little of it made sense. And I didn't really care about what happened in the 'real world' either, because I didn't really know any of the characters there, so any connection I had to them was extremely tenuous.

Anyway, it's a great movie and everyone should see it.",1558810317,maximumfun
jwghaller,"On rewatching the movie, I appreciate how people (like the bartender and the woman at the bait &amp; tackle shop) really kind of do give off the vibe of 'the NPC in the video game who has three pieces of information to give you and doesn't really have a whole lot else to say'. At a certain point, you think, ""Hmm, I guess this game has some kind of Dr. Bob sidequest that it really wants you to go on.""

The genre of game was a little confusing to me. I guess the kid is playing it? Or programming it? Or both? The only way to control it is to type lines of code, which will probably impact its sales. Maybe it's kind of like the Sims, but with more cat-rescuing and butts?

After 'The Rules' figures out that the Creator actually wants Dill to kill the guy, I thought it would have been fun for the Plymouth Island Radio announcer to say, ""It's a beautiful day here on Plymouth Island! A great day to go out there and kill your ex's husband!""",1558809922,maximumfun

groverjefferson,"The difficulty here is that it's an in-house show that got cancelled as opposed to an independently produced one, and the distinction between the two within the MaxFun universe is not always clear.

&amp;#x200B;

With something like Lady to Lady, it was a show that was produced independently, joined MaxFun, then left when the funding model was no longer viable. Same with Throwing Shade, Memory Palace, Song Exploder. I don't know if any of them used MaxFun recording space or equipment, or had to pay for use of said equipment, but the production staff and rights to the show were entirely with the creators.

&amp;#x200B;

Pop Rocket, meanwhile, was made in-house, with production costs borne by the network as well as some ownership rights (International Waters, Bullseye, JJGo would all fall under this umbrella as well, I'd imagine). I don't know the specifics, like if Guy or the panel had an ownership stake as well or were paid as staff, but there was more access to overhead funds there and greater ability to operate at a loss if donations were less than costs.

&amp;#x200B;

One solution (and who knows if it was offered) would have been to sign over the rights to the show to Karen/Wynter/Guy/Margaret, and let it be an independent production under MaxFun, giving them leeway to use their share of the donor money as they wished with less network support, but I'd imagine the numbers wouldn't make this viable either. As it stands, they're free to go make a fresh start on a new show, but without the existing RSS feed/hosting/social media accounts/etc (though it'd be nice if some of this could be extended as an olive branch, perhaps).

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, its a tough situation - I'm trying to think if this is the first show produced in-house that they've had to end ever, and Wham Bam Pow is the only other possible one that comes to mind. I hope Pop Rocket finds a way to go forward with new backing, am sad that the departure from MaxFun left bad feelings, and hope that things can go forward with some more clarity to listeners on this front to avoid this kind of anger and disappointment in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

From that post: 

Thanks to everyone for your support and kind words. I've been on a conference call for work, so I haven't had a chance to check in and read all the comments yet, but I did want to send a personal message to this beautiful, expansive community here on FB, where I began as just another Rocketeer among you, before becoming a guest panelist and full time member of the team. It's been an honor and a pleasure to share the recording booth with Gai Branham, Margaret Wappler and Wynter Mitchell Rohrbaugh these past several years. My own approach to teaching, and my ability to speak to a broader public, has been enhanced by having to stay sharp every week with these three champs in the ring.

I won't use this forum to get into the nitty gritty of how things went down or how I feel in a particular way about it. Let's just say, it was handled inelegantly and abruptly.

All this said, Wynter and I are indeed working on something fabulous that may also include Margaret and Guy's occasional involvement. It won't be Pop Rocket (we're wrapping that project for sure), but it's something we KNOW all of you will love, enjoy and appreciate. So let me reiterate, please follow or add us individually on our socials in the event that this community is ""retired"" or muted or transitioned or whatever the appropriate euphemism is for ""stripped away from us."" We're excited to continue on with all of you in the next phase of our growth and development as individuals, and as cultural producers.

In the meantime, BUY MY BOOK (tee-hee), and thanks to each and every one of you who has ever sent me a nice comment or note, or said hello to me at a restaurant or some other public forum, to let me--and us--know how much you appreciate our presence in your lives.
