yodatsracist,"You may already know but a few weeks ago I made a list of other good shows that are about something like Reply All “about the internet”:

Beyond the obvious This American Life (American life) and Radiolab (curiosity), I would recommend Rough Translation (American issues but how they are in another country), Revisionist History (something we’ve miss understand), Throughline (a social issue in the present as it appears in the past), Against the Rules (how we’re disrespecting referees and judges of all kinds), Planet Money (the economy), the Indicator (the economy but shorter), Criminal (crime), 99% Invisible (design), More Perfect (the American Supreme Court), What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law (constitutional law), Ear Hustle (prison), Decoder Ring from Slate (cultural objects), Those are the ones I always love.

There are a bunch of other that I either occasionally love or know other people love: Imaginary Worlds (Sci-Fi/Fantasy), the Stoop (Black life), Heavyweight (regrets), the Memory Palace (history), the Allusionist (language), Science Vs (Science), Hidden Brain (neuroscience/psychology), Every Little Thing (customs), Invisibilia (social science sort of), Israel Story (Israeli life), Twenty Thousand Herz (sound), Dark Net Diaries (the darker side of the internet).

There are a bunch of others that either are worse produced (like one or two people talking or reading into into a microphone, without multiple takes, like Lexicon Valley about linguistics or a bunch of the other shows listed here which I don’t like—I’d put the Stuff You Should Know podcast in here, and Futility Closet, and I don’t care for this style of podcast either) or just more interview based (I love Broken Record about music, Ad Absurdum about the laws in movies, How I Built This about entrepreneurship) or tell longer stories (In the Dark about one major crime person season, Revolutions about one revolution per season, Caliphate about ISIS, Charged about gun court, Serial, Bear Brook, S-Town, the Habitat about NASA prepping for a mission to Mars here on earth).

I want put out a special shout out to the BBC’s In Our Time. It’s a panel show with a host and a new set of four academics every week but they manage to get the academics to be brisk and conservational which is no mean feat. They cover everything from history to philosophy to literature to bits of science, and many episodes are quite good, especially the history ones (science and philosophy seem to fit the format less well).",1559376500,gimlet

LeMarc9723,"Noticed this days earlier and wondered why they'd decided to do the rebranding...The typeface changed from a modified version of LL Circular which looks modern and smart to the all-uppercase and more tight and compact Schemalfette Grotesk. And also, the brand color goes darker, nearly black, which feels more classic and pragmatic? We see no official explanation, but the change is so big and make people feel the brand tone has shifted, which in my perspecitve is not a good thing 'cause the new brand identity does harm to the brand equity Gimlet has accumulated through the years. In fact, [Gimlet had changed their logo slightly once before](https://twitter.com/lemarc9723/status/1133982200217554946), and this is the third time.

Q9XYZ,"Really good show with pretty good production value, incredibly interesting and weird topics but there is an obvious elephant in the room that one will address, for whatever reason, so here goes. Not intended to slight anyone, just bring it up so the show can deal with it, move past it, and continue to get better. I like the show a lot and wish them every success so please read this with the understanding the I am offering a critique, not criticism. 

And that elephant in the room is...one of the regular hosts is a third wheel and needs to up his game or somehow figure out how to deal with the two mature hosts. First there is the frequent, intrusive HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH overly LOUD and forced laughing (really harsh when wearing earbuds) to show that yes, he too gets the current conversational joke, just like the two mature guys. Additionally, this third wheel can’t stop mentioning where he went to college, and when speaking in long sentences frequently slurs his words together so I have to hit the 15-second back up button to catch what he is talking about. Relaxing, slowing down, and a little voice training and enunciation should help. Somehow there is a dynamic there where he is the odd guy out and it comes out plain as day throughout their shows. At least once one of the two mature hosts even directed a verbal slight toward the third wheel guy, during a show, and then Mr. Third Wheel sort of defended himself. So awkward. (Don’t recall which show it was, would have to go back and listen to all of them, which I don’t have time for).  

Funny thing is that when Third Wheel is given a topic to do by himself, or with his own guests, with apparently little or no pressure to ‘measure up’ to the two mature hosts, he is really pretty good. He’s got skills, so let’s figure this out and move forward. 

Finally, I don’t ‘blame’ (for lack if a better word) Third Wheel for any of this, the guy is just trying to do his job but is obviously struggling to fit in. (I have been there many a time myself and it really sucks). If there were any ‘blame’ it would have to be directed toward the management/leadership/editing function of the show. Surely someone there is removed enough from the actual show production to stand back and notice what I am trying to convey here, and then take subtle but effective steps to fix it.

stmariex,"As a Montrealer who has both studied and worked at McGill for many years, Concordia is leaps and bounds ahead of McGill for their computer engineering program. I'd say it's the stronger school in almost every program they have in common. McGill is riding on the strength of its name alone in a lot of fields while Concordia actually gets their students ready for the job market - really good co-op programs that actually teach you skills while McGill mostly teachers you theory that won't be practical (yes, I'm still a little bitter by how little I learned during my undergrad there). Concordia also provides a lot of resources for students that I never saw at McGill. I don't know if Sal is reading this, but he should be really happy with how things turned out!

As for Bragg's political outlook, yes, you're correct in that he's left-of-centre but has a traditionalist streak. I don't think this is unusual for people around his age and who do the kind of work he does. You also have to remember it's Britain, and the traditionalist themes run very deep, even when they don't quite seem to make sense when you stop and think about them (e.g. most English people will say they are Christians, or that ""England is a Christian country"", but also say they rarely, if ever, visit Church or pray. Now, religion is different for many people, but I think it's a real stretch to say two-thirds of the country is Christian). 

The Industrial Revolution episode I mentioned is the first one, just called ""The Industrial Revolution"". Bragg is keen to discuss how a certain kind of man developing and tinkering with machines was a key factor in the start of the revolution, and one of the professors is adamant that they weren't.

I will agree with you on the ""Gin Craze"" episode, I also liked ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"", ""The Highland Clearances"", ""The Great Irish Famine"", ""al-Biruni"", ""Hokusai"", ""Epic of Gilgamesh"", ""Prester John"" and others.",1558636749,gimlet

Betting it ends in him coming back (or is about the 5 stages of grief and she learns to accept it....I mean, she kind of created them alone with magic right? They rarely talk about how Wiccan And Speed are Visions kids, they only mention Wanda normally. I don’t know, my knowledge of those characters pre-Disassembled isn’t particularly deep). also, supposedly the Eternals movie will have a gay hero, so that’s something!

....also, the comics nerd in me felt the need to correct PJ in that Hulkling is not really a teen Hulk Guy, he’s more of an Alien that looks like Hulk and has nothing to do with the character, just named himself after him for symmetry with the original avengers. Same reason Wiccan is originally “Asgardian,” because he’s pretending to be more Thor than SW.

phaserburn725,"Because I can't help myself, I want to throw in a couple more things about Wiccan and Hulkling.  


PJ was mostly right about the history of Wiccan and Hulkling, although he got it a little backwards.  Hulkling is the one who has the shapeshifting abilities because he's half-Skrull (the alien race that was introduced to the MCU in the Captain Marvel movie).  The plotline about a ""gender switch"" actual DOES happen in Marvel comics with a DIFFERENT queer couple in ""Runaways"" between lesbian Karolina Dean and genderfluid Skrull Xavin.  


Also Wiccan's original codename was ""Asgardian"" as a call back to Thor.  All the Young Avengers originally had names that referenced the Avengers, even though only one of them had actual connections to the Avengers they were named after.  He changed his name In-Universe to Wiccan after he came out to avoid the inevitable jokes.",1558626459,gimlet

decentwriter,"Going to hop in on this discussion before it gets too flooded with comments and say the same voice of reason stuff I normally say on these threads. Sometimes in this subreddit it seems like people get up in arms about the fact that this show yes yes no-s too much. In the highly produced podcast world, which I also work in, it's obvious these shows are a lighter lift. And people do light lift shows because they're simultaneously in the background working on shows that are an extremely heavy lift. 

I don't know how many people here work on highly produced podcasts, but one 45-60 minute show can take 6 months to a year to make sometimes because of how many super tiny things have to happen -- reporting, script editing, recording the hosts, passing it off to lawyers who make changes that necessitate going back and rewriting/re-recording, developing art for the show, accounting for late breaking news, etc -- to make the show successful. Sometimes it'll take less time, perhaps 3 months, but in my experience that's a really quick turnaround time for an hour long episode of a podcast that gets heard by millions of people on multiple platforms. 

**All this to say, if your favorite podcast (ie. Reply All/any other show) does a ton of light lifts in a row, it's probably because they're busy working on an episode way more time intensive that we'll hear soon, but still want to get *something* out for listeners in the meantime. It's not because they don't give a fuck about listeners anymore. Patience is a virtue!**

yodatsracist,"It’s quite popular all over Europe, particularly in the form Aperol spritz, which is a popular summer drink on the menu of most cafes in at least Italy and France and I would guess most of Western Europe and parts of Eastern Europe.

It is not well-known in America. Until my wife ordered it for herself when we were on vacation in France, I was at best vaguely aware that Aperol was some European, bright-colored liqueur like Campari or Pernod. America just doesn’t have the same aperitif culture. If on a hot summer day you’re at a cafe or you’re at someone’s home waiting for dinner, you’re more likely to have wine or beer or perhaps even something like whiskey on the rocks rather than a liqueur. Very few “brand name” liqueurs are produced in the New World—off the top of my head, Kahlua and Curaçao. And even these are most often drunk in cocktails, not straight or with soda. The others that are made in the New World tend to be things like Hypnotiq or Alize or Malibu or Puckers , which tend to be associated either with clubbing or college students. The people who I’ve known who do serve digestif and aperitifs at home or order them at bars tend to be immigrants or the descendants of recent immigrants, often Italians. The first time I ever tried Campari it was given to me by an Italian-American from Bay Ridge. The first time I ever had a neat Amaretto it was from an Italian-American from outside of Boston; old Jews and other Eastern Europeans will of course also drink Slivovitz and other rot-gut brandies but these seems, in my subjective experience, less likely to go too deep into American-born generations. 

There’s just not the same liqueur culture, in my experience, in Europe and America. America is a big market, however, and that’s why you see things like Cointreau and Aperol being advertised periodically in America—these are European companies trying to break in. Occasionally, something will break through. Back around 2007, Fernet Branca all of a sudden caught on with the hipster-set just as Jagermeister had caught on with the bro-set. While I think Jagermeister remains a staple of frat parties nationwide, the craze for Fernet seems to have scaled back as “everyone heard of it” (at least in my experience). I think beyond those, the spirits that have caught on as fads tend to “catch on” are the classics: whiskeys (Bulleit, Buffalo Trace), gins (Hendricks), rums (my brother-in-law was just obsessed with one), and of course “ultra-premium” vodkas.",1558620209,gimlet

 “the Gin Craze”. I think they have more problem with novelists because it often seems to end up being mostly biography. Philosophers, poets, and Shakespeare can be a little bit better because they can get more into the work.

Rather than do good, take their profit and do more good if they're such do-gooders, they took shots and so did the hosts at a business with a social good attached.  This episode was stupid.  People would rather virtue signal than actually do something with virtue attached.  Ugh, I hated this one.

I know I'm beating a dead horse here, but even the long term vision struck me as faulty. There was a disconnect with science in general and with the science of human behavior. First of all, it would be extremely difficult to infer any relationship between genera patterns of activity and general outcomes because of the dimensionality of the data. Machine learning wouldn't tell you that there are actual relationships between the two. It would only produce an inscrutable model that would have some success (on average) in predicting an outcome, but that's of little use to an individual, and it wouldn't be able to explain why that outcome was predicted. Social scientists use experiments with rigorous controls to zero in on the effect of one activity or environmental circumstance in particular. So even the big data that the app accumulated wouldn't yield much behavioral insight unless it was analyzed with standard statistical models to yield very specific insights. 

Second, social science research has shown pretty definitively that knowledge has very little to do with behavior. So just informing people that not getting enough sleep, for example, is bad, won't help them change their behavior. I guess if your goal is to convince people that knowledge is the key and this persuades them to buy the product, it doesn't much matter if it ultimately helps them or not, but I don't think you're that cynical. 

What really does help though is comparison with one's peers. So for that reason the really interesting thing about the app was the feature that tracks the productivity of one's classmates. But that feature isn't at all protectable and Canvass could easily implement it and they wouldn't have to worry about the issue of attaining mass scale before it worked. 

I doubt you'll be interested in responding to any of that, but I was going to post my thoughts on he episode here even before I knew you were in this thread. And I'm sure you'll come up with better ideas, whether you think they are better or not.",1558317561,gimlet

There are a bunch of other that I either occasionally love or know other people love: Imaginary Worlds (Sci-Fi/Fantasy), the Stoop (Black life), Heavyweight (regrets), the Memory Palace (history), the Allusionist (language), Science Vs (Science), Hidden Brain (neuroscience/psychology), Every Little Thing (customs), Invisibilia (social science sort of), Twenty Thousand Herz (sound). 

There are a bunch of others that either are worse produced (like one or two people talking or reading into into a microphone, without multiple takes, like Lexicon Valley about linguistics or a bunch of the other shows listed here which I don’t like) or just more interview based (I love Broken Record about music, Ad Absurdum about the laws in random movies and stuff, How I Built This about entrepreneurship) or tell longer stories (In the Dark about one major crime person season, Revolutions about one revolution per season, Caliphate about ISIS, Charged about gun court, Serial, Bear Brook, S-Town, the Habitat about NASA prepping for a mission to Mars here on earth). 

I want put out a special shout out to the BBC’s *In Our Time*. It’s a panel show with a host and a new set of four academics every week but they manage to get the academics to be brisk and conservational which is no mean feat.

spshulem,"\&gt;Still interested to hear about where the tech goes if you shut down or how the tech integrates into a purchase.

Great question. It depends on how you get acquired. There are typically three outcomes in order of best outcome and least likely to worst outcome most likely:

1) They acquire the IP/tech, and the product itself, and they keep the product alive as a new or replacement to their product line.

&amp;#x200B;

2) They shut down the service but keep the underline technology and possibly integrate it into what they already have... but the core product is shut down.

&amp;#x200B;

3) They acquire the team and knowhow, but shut down the product and don't integrate or use anything.

By and large, they own everything regardless if they use it or not.

sjwillis,lol perfect response.  Nice,1558012193,gimlet
CozyAmigo,"I'm glad you've taken my comments constructively as they probably came across quite harsh. I think the main takeaway from your pitch is you need to pitch the product and company you are now not just what you will be 10 years down the line. Talk about the product you actually built and the value of brings to customers after that you can talk about the long term vision and how the current product gets to the long term vision. You were all long term and it took you ages to explain the current product and it wasn't clear at all how the current product becomes the one you were pitching. You were basically pitching a problem not a solution. An AI solution that helps with decision making and a task/productivity tracker are two different products which is why I think the investors couldn't reconcile your product with your pitch.
It was a little bit like you were pitching uber but only wanted to talk about self-driving cars and not ride hailing, despite having no self-driving tech ready to show.

Also I think the ""commitment"" concept is not a compelling story to investors at all. I think that was a big mistake. The comparison to a gym made no sense. People pay for a gym because of features (equipment, classes and space) that they do not have access to otherwise. Yes paying might make you slightly more committed but it's not the main reason. If a gym offered 95% of its facilities for free very few people would pay just to feel slightly more committed. 
Investors are going to want to see a clear value add for the paid tier that will compel people to sign up for it. That's a scalable approach. What you pitched was not scalable in slightest because you're not in control. You are relying on people to have an emotional response, to buy into your mission in order to pay you. It's almost like a donation. How did you even market the paid tier? ""Upgrade, there's very little difference but you'll use the product more."" You said thought it was a more compelling story to the investors but it's not a very compelling story to the customer so investors are unlikely to get on board. 

To end on a positive note, I think you've done incredibly well. To build a product and get funding and customers is a real achievement.  You shouldn't be upset with selling. Getting an exit is an achievement and can lead you to on to better things. That's what happened with founders of twitch. Good luck in future.

I put the cart before the horse on this one.

dcmldcml,"[This](https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCucot-Zp428OwkyRm2I7v2Q) is what's happening. James Charles is one of the most well-known of the beauty/makeup Youtube vlogging world, who got a lot of attention a few years ago as one of the first really prominent male makeup artists in that scene and ultimately landing a gig with Covergirl. He's also a 19 year-old with a long history of saying and doing racist/transphobic/just generally dumb shit. The beauty vlogger community has a reputation for being melodramatic, egotistical, petty, and provocative, and he's all of those things and more.

A day or two ago, another vlogger named Tati Westbrook posted a *43 minute-long rant video* exposing all the horrible stuff he'd said and done in the time they'd known each other (apparently they'd been close friends for quite a while - I only pay enough attention to this stuff to hear the ridiculous drama so I don't know all the details). It took off, James posted one of those absurd crying-apology videos, it got even more attention, etc etc etc, he's lost more than 1.5 million followers in 36 hours.

Do purchases online return lists of promotional coupons? If so is this a way to get the coupons for publishing? That would sort of align with the regularity of the requests (regular, but once or twice a month is not frequent on a digital platform).

Web ecommerce systems defer payment to payment systems. The payment systems send back authorisation tokens (web stores don't deal in credit cards, they deal in these tokens, that way they don't have to handle the risks associated with having the card details). Good systems will check that the authorisation token is for what the system says it is, but not so good systems might only test that the token is a valid token.

Why vary the location? It's not for the purposes of collection because no one ever collects.

If it was just a test script or a attempt to hack, and if you can't be bothered to vary name, why the address?

That backs up the idea of it being test against each store. Or possibly it's something that is coming from multiple devices located in different locations, or a mobile device that's  moving about a lot - and the store decision is based on the websites geo-location software. 

Could the location information even be the point of this? Send requests from a number of spoofed locations, read the store locations from the receipts and to compile a list of active stores? 

Maybe Dominoes is checking that the order distribution is fair - the right store gets the right order depending on geography? Or it's something the franchises are doing to make sure that orders are correctly routed and other franchise owners aren't getting more share of the business?

Rabbitshooter92,"I understand that, and I hope you're right. My one counter thought would be to maybe provide alternate listening material from gimlet, i.e. Crimetown or science vs like they've done in the past.

decentwriter,"I said this on the last episode post but I’ll say it again on this one because I think it’s important. I work as a producer on a podcast that’s of equal size and audience to Reply All. My podcast is probably one of the most well staffed teams in the entire industry, and I am so lucky with that, and we still do rebroadcasts ALL THE TIME because it’s just an extremely heavy lift to do 45 minutes to an hours worth of original content each time. Especially with shows like Reply All that do a ton of traveling and investigative things for their bigger shows. 

When a show is pushing out a bunch of rebroadcasts I can assure you it is because they’re a light lift which means the editors and producers can focus their time on a VERY cool project that is in the works. I know it’s challenging to believe that, and it’s especially challenging for me to convey just how much work goes into a highly produced show like Reply All. Patience! I have faith they’re working on something extremely cool based on the production and airing schedule they have been working off of the last few months. No doubt about it.",1557427404,gimlet

jcasa11,"A little late to get on this thread but I just listened and had to react. As a marketer, I can't help but feel like this is a staged event to some degree, whether the guys at Reply All are in on it or not doesn't make a difference. To me, this just couldn't have gone better for Dominoes. They get all sorts of former employees on talking about how they made great money and lifelong friends, they get people from all up and down the food chain talking about the processes behind your pizza and at the end of the day, you're simply just doing a lot of talking about pizza. I could be alone here but listening throughout the episode really made me want to order dominoes. Even if people all flock to the site to jokingly make Adam Pisces orders, site traffic is an important metric in getting advertisements and increased revenue to your department on top of the fact that I'm sure a fair amount of people would place an actual order once they've already made it to the site and plugged in all the info. I believe this started as a genuine thing that happened. Maybe some of their theories were right on the money as to the true reasoning behind the Adam Pisces orders. But by the time I get to the end and all the mysteriousness surrounding the call with Aaron, I feel as if he talked to his superiors who encouraged him to keep the mystery open-ended and let the hype and speculation around this story grow to keep us thinking about Dominoes and possibly get some orders out of it.   


Not trying to sound too conspiratorial, but as someone who works in marketing, if I were Aaron's boss I would sure as shit tell him to keep his mouth shut and keep this mystery alive, even if we knew what was going on.",1557413273,gimlet

There's about 5750 Dominos in the country, and if we assume that they can ""Adam Pisces"" each store once per week using more than just $2 cokes but less than consumable pizzas, $10 per store per week would be $3m in total liquid they could move around, which isn't a lot but could be ""enough.""

Hey Guys,

The conclusions you came to on this episode seem wrong.

Hackers aren't long term, they don't try and keep trying. They get bored and move onto the next thing.

What I believe is happening is the competitors are placing an order to each store every week or two, and when the order is placed they get back an order number unique to that store somehow.

So you order from Palm Springs store, get order # 10001, order two weeks later get order # 11001 - you subtract and now know they have done 1000 orders in that two week period. 

For a compeditor, this will tell you how your store is doing compared to the competition. You know if your marketing is working, if the market is increasing/decreasing - if you should open a store in that area etc etc. It would be true gold to Pizza Hut / Papa Johns. They may even pay a research company to do this for them.

Keep up the great episodes!

Cheers,

Ben

In my business I basically have to worry about two other competing companies. The competition is noticeable in all sorts of strange ways, such as employees are getting linkedin views from competing companies (presumably to monitor our growth). Helpdesk get calls with questions that about the amount of customers we have.
Monitoring your competitors seems to be a normal thing to do. We are also guilty of it.

Another way of doing this is placing fake orders. There is usually something in de html of the site that gives you a unique customer ID. So if you are doing this now and also a week later and the number has gone up by 50, you know how many new customers they have gained in a week.

4. Money laundering.

#1 seems unlikely since we have reports going back to 2016, and there's no hits for 'Adam Pisces' in any Github repo afaict. #2 seems like they would have figured it out and stopped it by now. I've seen academic researchers do #3 to get at sales data from those sketchy Pharma spammer businesses. In this case they'd also probably stop it? Unless they thought it was a potential buyer for the company doing due diligence.

#4 feels like a strong candidate. It explains the sudden 'it's not CC fraud, it's automated, and it's not us, but not not us and I can't say anything.' In this case, you'd be doing cash only _on purpose_. The problem is, who is getting paid to launder money? It was suggested it's a broad phenomenon, so it's not like one manager in an underperforming store. It's reportedly diffuse. Supposedly it's not any particularly large franchisee.

m9832,"Here are my thoughts.

* The fact that the orders are all made with the same name/item means whatever or whoever is submitting these either don't care or specifically want Domino's to be able to identify *they* placed the order..
* If this was some nefarious person who has the technical ability to 1) get access to the credentials and 2) likely automate this process, you would almost certainly randomize the names and ordered items to prevent detection.  If you have a scam going and were making money from it, you would do anything in your powers to keep it going as long as possible.
* Google ""[Domino's Pizza API](https://www.google.com/search?q=domino%27s%20pizza%20api)"" and you will see there are several projects to reverse engineer the Domino's site to allow ordering via any number of scripts.
* Check out how many integrations Domino's has out there: https://anyware.dominos.com/.  And those are just the ones for public use and consumption.
* Aaron Nilsson was so confident on the first call about ""ordered his fair share of 20 oz Cokes""...until he talked to some people still working there.
* What does someone gain from gaining access to a Domino's account?  You can't get the credit card.  You can place an order...but you need to either give your address for delivery or show up in person.  That would get you noticed real quick.  I don't buy the Pizza Plug thing either.


My theory:

These orders are coming from a red team, either internal to Domino's or hired by them to attempt to penetrate (or just test) the multiple systems Domino's has in place for online ordering.  Their 'success' signal is to place an order, as Aaron said, that doesn't cost the company anything.  Aaron changed his story and acted 'spooked' to keep the public thinking this was some nefarious credit card or credential hacker, likely attempting to keep copy-cats from slamming their system with 20oz Coke orders..

Brandon is saying that URLs cannot have '%' in them, [which is untrue, % is used to escape special characters!](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp). But why the heck would the headunit want to connect to a URL? The audio and metadata are coming over bluetooth - this has nothing to do with a URL. The only explanation is if the front end software is connecting to a localhost socket and the URL that is constructed in is based on the bluetooth metadata passed in. For example, if the bluetooth metadata says the album name is ""Reply All"" maybe the URL being constructed is http://localhost/Reply%20All . In the case of 99% Invisible the URL that should be constructed is http:/localhost/99%20%25Invisible . But if the dev constructed the URL poorly, then they could have done this http:/localhost/99%Invisible . In that URL, %I doesn't mean anything the HTTP stack can understand, so it barfs or it hangs (the URL http:/localhost/99 doesn't exist).

Now why the heck they would use localhost it beyond me. The media actually plays, so it is possible they have a fallback mediaplayer in case the ""good one"" fails.

FYI, other notes:
- The SW on this unit is written in different languages, just like all the different SW on your computer. The bluetooth stack is in C. The UI framework is probably in Qt. The app layer is either Java or C.
- If you think it's scanf or printf, %I is a 12-hour date format in C (and probably in Qt). But I can't imagine how the specifiers in a Scanf function (or equivalent) are being dynamically set by values in the input stream itself. This is a really strange thing for a dev to do.",1556223877,gimlet

kotikfriend,Just listened to the podcast and am surprised at the conclusion that it is likely someone preparing a breach. It seems like the question is still very much open and not a clear cut either/or situation as the hosts speculate at the end. There are a number of possibilities that remain. For instance it could be a third party testing out the Domino's API to possibly interface it with one of their apps without Domino's permission (like Postmates for instance). Listening to the episode this seemed like a likely explanation the whole time that was never clearly ruled out.

They concluded it was a hacker or hacker group  preparing to do a large-scale attack on Dominos by stealing real Domino's accounts and placing a large number fake orders simultaneously, with the fake Adam Pisces coke orders being a test run of their script for that. They wouldn't have to steal and test CC numbers for that, the real credit cards would just be saved in the account.

MountainLeader,"Something about the conclusions they reached don't feel quite  right or complete to me.

It was super curious that Aaron clammed up. But he did say he believed it was scripted. So, aside from hackers, it could also possibly line up with use of an external pen testing team, and not being able to disclose known vulnerabilities.

To me, the facts don't line up with the people using Dominos to test stolen card details theory. If Dominos were the ideal place for this kind of test, surely *lots* of scammers would be doing this. I think it's a step too far to believe lots of different scammers are all going to have settled on using one psuedonym. Instead you'd have lots of different pseudonyms and ""Adam Pisces"" wouldn't be particularly remarkable. Yet no one said ""Oh yeah, sometimes it's this name, sometimes it's that"". That ""Adam Pisces"" stands out the way it does indicates that this isn't really happening.

landscapespuzzleme,"the National Labor Relations Board! they administer union elections and do all sorts of other shit.

unions have traditionally gone through the NLRB to have a union election. to file for an election at the NLRB, you have to have at least 30% of the people in the bargaining unit sign a union card to indicate interest. but lots of unions nowadays don't go that route, since you don't actually have to -- if you get a majority of people to sign union cards (not just 30%), an employer can ""voluntarily recognize"" the union, with the cards essentially acting as a vote.

many progressive (""progressive"") digital media companies have been effectively pressured into voluntary recognition. it's like, people decided they wanted a union, so they signed cards -- why have a revote via election?

at Gimlet, they did an online election which is NOT with the NLRB. that's another option. sometimes you can't pressure a company to voluntarily recognize, so the next best thing to avoid the NLRB is an online election administered by a third party company. some companies do that. the results are never different! people who signed cards vote Yes, people who didn't sign a card don't vote or they vote No.",1556057203,gimlet
landscapespuzzleme,"lots to cover here!! I'm a union organizer. I commented on some other threads to clarify stuff if you want to look at my comment history. I like to seize on any opportunity to explain this stuff!

fundamentally the union and management need to come to an agreement on who is in the union (the ""bargaining unit""). this happens not only when a new union is formed -- like at Gimlet -- but also when existing unions hire new positions. management will always want to cut out people at the top that they deem ""supervisors"" but they'll also want to try to trim the edges and argue that certain people aren't in the ""community of interest"". so when a new union is being formed, the union's organizing committee + union counsel/staff negotiates with the company (usually a combination of upper management and outside counsel that the company hires) over who is included. since it's a negotiation, you don't always get who you want. 

since it's definitely in the union's best interest to have a broad a unit as possible (Gimlet Union won a really good unit here btw, if you read the article they got a ton of titles), and it's in management's best interest to have as narrow a unit, basically what happens is that workers have to exert pressure on the company to try to get them to move and agree to include more people. and they usually do move! things like tweeting at the boss, wearing union pins at work, etc all actually have an effect on the executives. they see people are serious about it!

Kowber,"&gt; What could the employer possibly be giving/threatening that the union would be willing to cut 1/3rd of their members?

Agreeing to recognize the union, as opposed to going to the NLRB for adjudication. Sorting out who is management and labor is complicated, and so the employer can say, OK, you can have a union, but we're going to define labor narrowly, so the union represents a smaller group of people. If the union wanted to fight that, they could, but it would be a longer road. That, and the NLRB right now is extremely anti-union.",1556055298,gimlet

CozyAmigo,"As I said starlee came to gimlet with a ready produced pilot of mystery show, she came as a host not just a generic employee. Based on this, the fact that it's pretty hard to make one show at a time let alone work on multiple and the fact that she didn't show up in the credit of any other gimlet show there is absolutely no reason to assume she was working on anything else. We know Alex B was working on all the shows at the beginning as he felt his methods were vital to their success but unless you have proof otherwise all the facts we have say starlee wasn't. There's no way there are fully finished episodes lying around. Starlee has been so open about blasting gimlet, about not getting the brand back, not getting any revenue split, not being happy about the ads changing. If there were unreleased episodes she would say, if they were even 50% finished eps she would say. I can't see there being anything more than stray recordings and notes. Yes that's an assumption but it's a pretty well supported by all of starlee's tweets and public comments. She would be screaming for her eps back if they were holding on to them. Your logic seems to be ""we don't know"" which is true but you're just making up a narrative that puts starlee in a better light but that seems to go against any evidence we actually have. What we know is that 6 episodes were released one of which was made before starlee worked at gimlet and that the majority of gimlet shows release more content. Nothing in my original comment was inaccurate.",1555831038,gimlet

I hope this becomes the takeaway from all of this. There's a viral tweet that I can't find right now that says something like ""oh, you think you're friends with your boss? Try and start a union.""",1555818931,gimlet
landscapespuzzleme,"there are often at least a few people who end up out of the union because the union made concessions during negotiating the bargaining unit (the people in the union), because it’s a negotiation and so both sides generally give concessions. the union usually holds a line for some length of time, with workers taking part in escalatory workplace actions to pressure the company. so there was probably some amount of that stuff going on internally.

in terms of how standard this is, there’s basically always a fight! going back to my last comment, often a digital media company will quickly say “okay, we’ll voluntarily recognize you... but only this certain group of people!” and so then the fight is over the bargaining unit because that’s where the company is going to pull some shady shit. 

it feels extra fucked up when “progressive” bosses like Alex (or Spotify) fight a union. but a boss is a boss!",1555818764,gimlet
PM_ME_MICHAEL_STIPE,"So does that mean that the union likely cut down their membership? What if the union refuses to do that? 

Is this a pretty standard way for something like this to play out? You make it sound like this is the way things normally go.

landscapespuzzleme,"before you even get to a signed voluntary recognition agreement or an election agreement, you have to agree on who is in the union. 

so there’s generally two fights in this beginning stage of forming a union: 1) how you’ll get official recognition (voluntary vs election) and 2) who will be in your union. workers and organizers often push for the broadest group possible. management always wants to cut it down, usually starting at the top (“supervisors”) and around the edges (workers they don’t think share a “community of interest” with everyone else). then you negotiate and agree on who’s in the union. so they had that whole fight, and then agreed to/ran an election.",1555810652,gimlet

1) **through voluntary recognition**, which is what they were asking for, and what [most](https://nypost.com/2018/01/11/vox-media-agrees-to-bargain-with-labor-union/) [digital media](https://wwd.com/business-news/media/refinery29-management-recognize-union-effort-1202989403/) [companies](http://www.newsguild.org/mediaguild3/editorial-staff-of-new-york-magazine-secures-voluntary-recognition-of-their-union/) are doing at this point. when a majority of workers sign union cards, the company has the option to voluntarily recognize the union.

2) **through an election**. you can have an election via the National Labor Relations Board, which is the most traditional way to get official recognition and how most unions do it. or you can have an election via an online vote administered by a company that runs online votes (of any type, not just union elections).",1555771229,gimlet

DaftPunkyThrash,"It’s been a while since I took Labor Law, but my recollection is that a union can first attempt to demonstrate to management that it has a majority of support and, if management agrees, it can voluntarily recognize the union as a bargaining unit.  If management refuses, the employees can request that the NLRB hold an election to determine if a majority of employees want a union.  If a majority then chooses a union, the union will be certified by the NLRB and the employer is required to recognize the union for bargaining. 

So, if the Gimlet Union held an election, that almost certainly means that Gimlet management refused to voluntarily recognize the Union.  They now have a recognized Union by law due to the election, but not because management agreed to recognize them—they don’t have a choice.",1555765462,gimlet

smog_alado,"A stray %d would only cause printf to output gibberish. It would likely print the current contents of a machine register or of a position in the program stack, formatted as a decimal integer. The exact behavior would depend on the system architecture but it most likely wouldn't lead to an outright crash.

A %s would be more dangerous. This directive instructs printf to dereference a pointer. If the pointer points to invalid memory this can result in a crash. If the pointer points to valid memory then it can output *a lot* of gibberish before it find the first zero byte and stops. %s can also be very dangerous with other functions of the printf family (like sprintf), as in these cases it can easily lead to a buffer overflow.

%n is the directive with the most potential for destruction in a situation like this. Like %s it also instructs printf to dereference a pointer, however, with %n printf attempts to write to the pointed address instead of trying to read from it. This is even more likely to break things outright.

For many years, I wrote magazine articles and books, often on nature and the environment and different branches of history...a long way from the good you do. But sitting opposite the people I was interviewing, I asked them to share their obsessions with me, to allow me to write about them for the public, to trust me with the things they cared most about. That was an expression of faith as well, and I was always grateful for their trust.

1. They take the title ""99% Inv"" and concatenate with something...say ""%d:"" to denote episode number ==&gt; to generate formatString = ""%d:99% Inv"".  They didn't sanitize their title string...
2. Now they use the format string in some sort of ""print formatted data"" function ==&gt; printf(formatString, podcastNum);
3. Here there is no second argument, so it might not behave well.

Note that this is only an example.  In c++ the ""n"" would have to be right next to the % in order for this to break potentially.",1555455479,gimlet
JamminOnTheOne,"Sure.  Note near the top, where it shows that a format specifier can actually be a compound of a few different inputs:

&gt;%\[flags\]\[width\]\[.precision\]\[length\]specifier 

So there's a single-letter specifier by default, but it can be modified by inserting various other characters between the % sign and the specifier.  In the case of %n, which writes a value to an address, you can optionally tell printf how to interpret that pointer (see the table describing ""length"").  So %hn specifies that it is a short integer pointer, and %ln specifies that it is a long integer pointer, etc. (you can insert any of the length indicator characters between % and 'n').  There are also some non-standard length indicators used on certain platforms; [the WikiPedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string#Length_field) shows that %In is one of these.",1555455451,gimlet

I know the programmer of the stereo software said that he didn't use C or printf directly, but he could've been using a buggy library.  He said that it was likely that a string wasn't escaped when it was supposed to be.  Yes, that's exactly what you should do before passing an inputted string to printf.

The Gimlet engineer who was on the show talked about the ""[printf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string)"" programming function, which is used to dynamically create text (e.g., it's a common way to create text like ""You have 3 new episodes"", inserting the number 3 into an otherwise-static string), and how ""%i"" can be a dangerous command inside a string if it is passed to the ""printf"" function.  On Reply All, they tried a bunch of different percent strings and couldn't reproduce the problem, so assumed that it wasn't due to printf.

The thing is, the \*most dangerous\* printf command is %n, which attempts to modify data within a program.  Used incorrectly, it will crash a program.  One variant of %n is ""%In"" (I won't get into the details of what the 'I' does, but it's just as dangerous and likely to crash a program).

tinkletwit,This episode was infuriating to listen to. It is the height of pretentiousness to use philanthropy as a means of showing off your wealth or expiating your guilt. The principal problem for them with this business is that they can't brag about how much money they donated to homelessness through it (because they expect the money to come back) and they can't use it to feel better about themselves either because it wouldn't be a sacrifice. They don't give two shits about making an impact on a problem. They find the whole business model threatenimg to their phony conscience. That's why they didn't invest. Fuck them.,1555285605,gimlet

It's a shame, because it's probably true that some would demonize him for investing in a for-profit solution to homelessness.

Or she will put that money into her charity foundation.

If there's a firmware update but you don't have a USB port, you'd need to have a dealership do it. However, if your car doesn't have a USB port there's a good chance it's old enough that they no longer release updates but again it depends on what kind of Prius you have. Furthermore, you have some version of Entune running in that head unit. The worst infotainment platform in existence.

hsalfesrever,"Considering Alex was a former network engineer, I was pretty surprised how quickly he went along with some clearly wrong ideas about how technology works.

One of the early theories about 99PI episodes being encoded in a strange format for example.  If the user is listening to the episode via Bluetooth, the format of the file is meaningless. The file itself is not being transmitted to the car stereo, just the audio and metadata.  If the issue was with the file itself, it would be the phone crashing, not the car stereo.

That immediately limits the causes to either something in the audio (ie: a specific tone), or something in the metadata (highly more likely, since the car media system is a computer program executing commands).  

Also, making a bunch of highly specific podcasts with all VERY different test cases, although entertaining, is a supremely bad way to debug.  A better way would be to create a podcast with metadata used on the episodes that caused the problem, then slowly remove metadata until the problem no longer exists.  That would 100% identify the exact string in the metadata causing the problem.

Admittedly though, if I debugged the problem, we might have solved it much faster, but there would  have been 0% of the delightfulness that Alex created in the mini-podcasts :)",1555016625,gimlet

madamepsychose,"Nah, it's much more likely that `%I` is meant for formatting a specific data type, like an integer. You don't usually see formatting directives like that related to styling/displaying text; they're for interpolating values into a string when those values may or may not already be strings themselves.

A simple example:

`fmt.Printf(""I've got %d problems"", 99)`

The %d here tells the compiler that you're trying to interpolate an integer into a string. In the example below, `""99""` is already a string so you can use %s instead, but that code would throw an error if `99` were an integer.

`fmt.Printf(""I've got %s problems"", ""99"")`",1555006394,gimlet

badhusbamd,"Good questions! For my side I only heard updates when Alex would call me and we would record our conversation. I knew he had talked to Roman when he brought up Roman's theory on the % being the issue. I had no clue what podcasts he was sending me so I had live reactions to those and was definitely insanely shocked he got Sarah Koenig involved. I didn't realize who Samin was until later, as I have seen her Netflix show. But yeah he just gave me an RSS feed and then let me react and say how it was affecting my car. 

He knew the first two, *\^space\^* and *{Blank} + {Blank} = Fun* probably wouldn't kill my car but he was definitely certain that *100% Related* would. Alex was extremely shocked and frustrated it didn't. We tried different numbers  in front of the % sign and another unrelated not their podcast called 99*% Craps* to try and trigger a freeze but both worked fine. I joked at the end of the call that Alex probably had a schedule that said ""solve problem"" on the day he sent me those three and now my car had messed it all up, and he laughed and basically said yeah. So that's definitely where the story morphed into something slightly different.

I was a bad boy and messed around with the % letter combos just because. I felt really bad that I had the tech problem with me and Alex couldn't just come and mess around in my car, I live quite far away from him. So after I discovered it was '% I' he very politely told me to let him work which I totally respected.

They did say that the code wasn't c++, so it's hard to guess what exactly is happing.  It would be easier to guess if they named the language.

I coincidentally wrote a podcast download script in python a while back and I remember having to ""sanitize"" titles and urls in order to work with file system operations. It's not a stretch to say that whatever language the infotainment system just didn't handle certain titles/urls and threw an unhandled exception, then went to a catch all handler and restarted the software.  Doesn't necessarily have to be a watchdog/heartbeat type of mechanism and a crash.

maxtmaples,"Hey Ben! I have a question!

I’ve always been curious about how the RA team changes or morphs the telling of a story in the service of entertainment. This episode seems to be a great example of this, because whereas one podcast team may have created a simple, straightforward story about solving a tech problem, the RA team was able to add this whole extra layer about the individual quirkinesses of podcast hosts and blend it into the tech-support story seamlessly.

So my question is this: how much did you know about the other side of this story while you were working on it with them? Did you know Roman and Sarah and Samin would be involved? Did everyone pretty much know beforehand that those joke podcasts weren’t going to help diagnose the problem?

CozyAmigo,"I think Michael is massively wrong on this and I don't think anyone actually made the main argument of why this is ethical. They are not taking money from homeless people. If they were taking a commission from donations that would be sketchy but customers are the cities and organisations. That money is getting spent anyway in a way less effective way. If this works the cities save a huge amount of money so having this out in the world means the money currently being spent can help a lot more people. Growing this aggressively isn't a conflict as the faster it scales the more cities save, the faster you tackle some of the major issues. The profit they are making is really small compared to the value it brings. And the return to investors can be seen as the cost of incentivizing people to get on board with the mission, similar to the cost of running ads to get donations. They are not taking money from the homeless but taking a small portion of what they save cities so that they can reach more people faster and be self sustaining. There's no issue",1554975916,gimlet

JimmyTheCrossEyedDog,"I'm 100% with Jillian on this. Every business exists to solve a problem and benefits its customers by doing so. Why is the fact that the customers are cities trying to help homeless people a problem? If the business is exploitative or ineffective, the cities will stop using it and it'll fail. If the business actually helps homeless people (and the cities that want to help them), then it's a win-win for everyone, investors included.

I was baffled by Michael's comment saying ""I don't need the money, these homeless people need it more, so I don't want to skim off the top."" In theory, there's two business models here, with totally made up and probably grossly misproportioned numbers:

- VC-Funded: Homeless people get a million in value, Michael gets 2 million.
- Non-profit: Homeless people get a hundred thousand in value, Michael gets nothing.

If the fact that Michael gets all that money makes the first option possible, of course I'm going to choose it. As long as I can do more good, I'm agnostic to the money I have to give to other people to heighten that good (and perhaps, since he says he doesn't need more money, he could give it all to charity afterward. Even greater good!) Scaling just means you can do more good more efficiently, sustainability means your good engine can run itself.

TheAllRightGatsby,"Well I haven’t listened to it yet but I do hear that season 3 of Serial is basically what you are looking for, an exploration of the way the justice system interacts with criminal cases like this and drives outcomes. 

To be honest I haven’t listened to On the Inside in so long that I don’t really remember how it was set up; I remember it starting with Paul’s blog, and my best recollection is that it was clear to me Sruti had started pursuing the story because of her fascination with the character of Paul. So it being about whether or not Paul was guilty made sense to me since her entry point was her personal investment in who Paul was. I also felt like Serial was VERY clearly about whether or not Adnan was guilty, since the whole season literally starts with her saying she’s spent the past year trying to figure out what happened in 30 minutes on a certain day when Adnan was in high school (aka whether or not he committed the crime). But I also think Sarah does a good job of laying out the evidence on both sides of the case and then basically saying, “I still don’t really know if Adnan did it or not, but one thing I do know is that there’s no way his guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt, so there’s no way he should be in prison today,” which is a striking commentary on the justice system. But sure, I take your point that it’s tough to know at the outset where a story is going to go.",1554476337,gimlet
Bobby_Surra,"Maybe I should have stated, that I generally love the topics Sruti reports on. This is why I am invested in it. So I have pretty high standards if I am invested in something. To your point: I don't think that the story was set up in a way so that you could anticipate that it was about Paul Modrowskis guilt. But it is interesting that you mention serial season one. I had the exact same problems with the way Sarah Koenig tried to find out if Adnan Syed was guilty in the last eps of the season. I get that this is part of the appeal for many, but I guess my viewpoint on these things is different. I search for the inherent systematic contradictions like for example the jurisdictional system. I also have no ideas about anyone's goals on reporting a story. It started as a story of the blog of Paul and evolved in this specific manner.

But I think a story should broadly be judged on whether or not it accomplishes the goals it set out to accomplish, not whether you wanted it to accomplish a completely different set of goals.

And at first I liked Sruthis stories very  much. Sruthi has a very likeable voice and ""radio""-appearance. She chooses very interesting and from a social perspective important topics. Also she produces the kind of long and grand stories. Every story she reports has an very deep empathetic view point where she tries to understand the motivation of what is going on. And she tells everything in this very heartbroken voice, which to me seems totally apropriate in some cases but totally over the top on others. I am always very interested in the stuff she reports but at the same I come out of these reply all episodes feeling that all her stories are about her in a way and what she experienced. That is not an unimportant viewing angle but sometimes takes away from the inherent criticism. For example the ""on the inside"" eps feel to me as though in the end it only matters if the listeners (or Sruti) believe Paul Modrowski is innocent or not. It could have been a great reporting of the injustice of justice systems. Of the boundaries of diagnosing autism and what this could mean for courts and jurisdiction.

I was a huge Invisibilia fan but their last two episodes haven’t sat well with me. 2 weeks ago it was “chronic pain is all in your head!” I was incredibly insulted and disgusted.  The new episode is just too uncomfortable for me because it seems to be about electro shock therapy or something similar, any other thing a lot of fun chronically ill people like me deal with.

As a person who is easily anxious when talking about money one on one, or having an issue at work one on one or anything one on one with a boss, the feeling of having collective bargaining and rights decided by people on your level has been so freeing to me it’s incredible.

Entire_Law,"Hi--- English as a foreign language teacher weighing in here. I'm originally from the states and have  lived in various European countries the past couple years teaching English. 

First of all, my gut reaction was that there was no way this kid was not a native English speaker. His accent is fantastic, and more importantly, his use of grammar and vocab is flawless. Some phrases that really stood out that ""tongue-tied"" ""and the rest is history."" In terms of grammar he effortlessly used a third conditional inversion ""I would have been happy had he like gotten there safely."" Using ""Had he gotten there"" to mean ""If he had gotten there"" is very very high level. Even my highest level advanced students don't usually use that structure organically. WOW. 

I thought about it though, and I do know a few people like this. My current boss at the academy I teach is an Italian woman- never lived in an English-speaking country, but she speaks English like she's from California. She said she learned it from listening to music and watching TV. My other boss at the same place on the other hand actually lived in the states for a year when he was younger, yet he says stuff like ""Are you over?"" to mean ""Are you done?"" HA. I had a friend from Argentina who talked like a native speaker too now that I think about it- same thing, just learned it from consuming American media. And I had a friend from Bosnia like that too. I've had a couple kid students that talk like this as well, maybe 3 in my seven years of teaching. Same thing- they've never lived abroad and don't speak English in their daily lives, but they watch so much TV/movies/internet videos in English they pick it up. Of those 3 kids, two of them I believe were on the spectrum. One of them was 8 years old- he had a sister a year older than him who couldn't say much more than ""Hello how are you."" But this kid  knew almost EVERYTHING. It was insane! With the other kids we were learning colors and numbers and the present tense. I remember he even knew the word ""quarter,"" like to refer to the American coin, which obviously isn't used in his country. I asked him where he learned it and he said ""probably Spongebob."" 

So yeah, it's definitely possible. The number one thing to learn a language is the time you spend with it. He says he watched Youtube videos- that makes total sense to me. Also he talks about reading in English. If he read novels like Catch 22 that's a lot of great vocabulary. 

Also, he most definitely did not start learning English in high school by memorzing  vocabulary words in his notebook at school. If you listen carefully he says the words he was memorizing while bored in school was SAT vocabulary- those are words even native speakers don't know.  That's how you become a master not just an acceptable user. Chances are he learned the basics of English as a young kid, maybe at school, consumed a lot of American media, then because he was very intellectually curious put in a focused effort to learn even more high-level words like SAT vocab. And it paid off. 

So yeah idk this kid but him learning English to that level despite his circumstances is definitely possible. And good for him. ",1554202178,gimlet

After several hours of baiting and pretending like I was hurrying as fast as I could to my nearest western union, whilst also constantly complimenting her baking skills and getting “her” into character as my all-time favorite cook, I got the hacker to agree that the secret ingredient was kale, after this long and intense conversation about food allergies. Eventually I outed the hacker, citing that the REAL lady would never eat kale since she’s deathly allergic (also fabricated), and made the person running the account respond with a delightful string of profanities when I told them I knew this was all fake and would be reporting the account.

salliek76,"&gt; PHIA: Maybe there's gonna be a couple bonuses. Okay, so the first story we’re going to update is Sruthi’s medical mystery: Episode #42, ""Blind Spot.""

&gt; ALEX: So, this episode... we got more emails about this episode than any other episode.

&gt; PJ: Is that true?

&gt; ALEX: I think so.

&gt; PJ: Could be true.

&gt; ALEX: Might be true.

&gt; PJ: We got a lot of emails about this episode because it ended on a cliffhanger. And people wanted to know what had happened. So should we tell them what happened? Should Sruthi tell them what happened?

&gt; SRUTHI PINNAMANENI: Hello!

&gt; PJ: Hey, Sruthi.

&gt; ALEX: Hi, Sruthi.

&gt; SRUTHI: So, so, so, we are gonna talk about Hope. So just a quick summary, we did a story about a woman who we called Hope. She had her body basically break down in every possible way. She couldn’t figure out what it was, she felt as if the doctors were misdiagnosing her. And so she goes online and finds a website where people—a group of strangers, basically—they give her a bunch of different diagnoses. And one of the things they say she might have is something called SCM syndrome. It has to do with a muscle in your neck. Anyway, she get some neck massages, goes to the chiropractor, and... it works.

&gt; PJ: Right, the advice she got from the website, she followed it and her pain went away, and so for her, it was like, this website fixed my mysterious ailment. But when you started reporting it, you talked to other experts who said like actually, not only might Hope not have been cured by a website on the internet, but she might have this underlying condition that is very serious and could be fatal, and so she might have just like fixed the symptom, and be in a lot of danger.

&gt; SRUTHI: Yeah, exactly. And so when we left off, Hope was off to go do this one last test to see whether she had that condition called a carotid dissection.

&gt; PJ: So what happened?

&gt; SRUTHI: I’m going to tell you what happened, but first I have to tell you this other thing.

&gt; PJ: What's the other thing?

&gt; SRUTHI: So hang in there for a sec. After the episode aired, we got some really eerie emails. Like one from this guy, a man who heard our show while driving home from church, and he was like wait, is this a show about my wife?

&gt; KYLE: I kept perking up more and more on the drive home as I was like oh my gosh, that too, like yeah, totally, yeah, that's been our experience.

&gt; SRUTHI: So that’s Kyle, and his wife Mel had been having these horrible, horrible headaches. For months.

&gt; MEL: That headache lasted for like 45 days and then I went to the hospital.

&gt; SRUTHI: Oh no.

&gt; MEL: And then the headache came back. It was 108 days. Straight.

&gt; SRUTHI: She tried all of these different procedures. One of them gave her an aneurysm. And same thing as with Hope, doctors told her it was one thing, but none of the treatments for those things were working, so she just was at a loss.

&gt; KYLE: At the point of me listening to this story, we didn't have any path that was... hopeful.

&gt; MEL: We were at the end. Of every path.

&gt; KYLE: Yeah, yeah. You know, we were looking at... The next course was basically this procedure where they cauterize some nerves in your neck. Stop those nerves from firing the pain signals.

&gt; PJ &amp; ALEX: Ooh!

&gt; SRUTHI: Yeah. She was terrified, but she just wanted these symptoms to go away, so after she heard the episode, she tried massaging her neck the same way that Hope did, and just like that, the symptoms went away. And at first she didn’t believe it. But she kept doing it.

&gt; MEL: It seems like crazy, like when I tell people, I'm like, ”All I'm doing is just squeezing this muscle.” And everybody's like, ""How's it going squeezing that muscle?"" I'm like, ""I'm still good! It's really weird!"" But, totally back to life as normal. Like, 100%.

&gt; ALEX: Sruthi, that is an amazing story, but I really wanna know what happened to Hope.

&gt; SRUTHI: So, I spoke to Hope. She got the test, a scan for something called a carotid dissection. And the test came back completely clear. She definitely doesn’t have it. When I spoke to her, she was in an airport. It was super loud. She was on her way to London and then to Iceland, she was going just on holiday, she was super excited, and she sounds just great.

&gt; HOPE: Um, so I’ve just been continuing what I was doing, which is going to the chiropractor, physical therapy, doing stretches for my head and neck. So that’s what I’ve been doing.

&gt; PJ: That’s awesome.

&gt; ALEX: She went from being totally debilitated to like, you know, traveling the world.

&gt; SRUTHI: Yeah. I’m really happy for her, I’m happy for Mel, and anyBODY else who got something out of listening to that episode. However, I really don’t understand this thing Hope thinks she has, the SCM syndrome. I spoke to so many different doctors and all of them said they couldn’t explain why the symptoms would have been relieved. And so if anyone is having these kinds of symptoms, I want to make sure, just check with a doctor first. And yeah, we’re definitely not the experts.",1554088108,gimlet

landscapespuzzleme,"hey! this is not totally accurate. the WGAE was quite literally formed to address (to a certain extent) writers' IP in film &amp; television. 

as for digital media, it's dealt with in a few contracts, but is, as you can probably guess, difficult to bargain over since companies want to keep as much of your IP as they can!! and what's in a contract is really dependent on what workers want to prioritize. so **protecting** IP hasn't been a major priority for many shops until now -- IP has been broadly addressed in some contracts (like [the HuffPost one](https://www.wgaeast.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/HuffPost-CBA-January-26-final2.pdf)) but it's usually to just create clearer guidelines over it, not necessarily to protect it. but actually the HuffPost contract has a ""Derivative Works Incentive Bonus Program"" where a worker gets a certain % if the company creates new work based on content created by a HuffPost union member. so that's interesting!!

WikiTextBot,"**Work for hire**

In the copyright law of the United States, a work made for hire (work for hire or WFH) is a work subject to copyright that is created by an employee as part of his or her job, or some limited types of works for which all parties agree in writing to the WFH designation. Work for hire is a statutorily defined term (17 U.S.C. § 101), so a work for hire is not created merely because parties to an agreement state that the work is a work for hire.  It is an exception to the general rule that the person who actually creates a work is the legally recognized author of that work.  According to copyright law in the United States and certain other copyright jurisdictions, if a work is ""made for hire"", the employer—not the employee—is considered the legal author.

DashSnowden,"Oh yes, great question! Namely the inclusion of this line item:

&gt;Equitable processes for protecting employees' intellectual property

So U.S. copyright law includes this thing called [""work for hire""] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire) wherein: ""the employer—not the employee—is considered the legal author"" of any work done for the company. I.e., if work is created by a Gimlet employee for Gimlet, then Gimlet owns the copyright to that work and can do with it whatever they like irrespective of the employee's wishes.

But ""intellectual property"" takes it a step further, and includes not just copyrights but patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. That covers A LOT of territory.

The union is requesting ""equitable processes for protecting employees' intellectual property,"" whereas the employee-employer agreements as they stand now presumably transfer all IP rights to Gimlet, and as such, the employees currently have no ""intellectual property"" to protect. I would GUESS that the employment agreements signed by all new Gimlet hires cover this pretty extensively.

It's tricky because both sides can make strong arguments here. Totally hypothetical but think of it this way: Should Gimlet have allowed the creator of ""Mystery Show"" to shop the second season of her podcast to other networks after Gimlet fired her and cancelled her show? OR: Should the show's creator have had the freedom to shop ""Mystery Show"" to other networks irrespective of Gimlet's wishes/interests/involvement? OR: what? Whichever side you take here, I can offer a compelling counterargument for the other side.

Anyway that is just one very high-visibility (and again, totally hypothetical) example of the potential conflict. The Gimlet Union would like for this to be settled for ALL employees ""equitably"" in advance, which seems not-unreasonable, except that there's no ""equitable"" solution because of the inherent power imbalance and assumption of risk that exists at the ""in advance"" stage of all these agreements.

Also, WGA doesn't deal with IP traditionally. Look at all the contracts thus far collectively bargained by WGAE especially, and if you find a single one of them that includes an IP clause (or any mention of IP), please share it here, because I can't remember seeing one (and I've worked fairly closely with this). Podcasts are such a different medium though, and as a result, IP functions so much differently in podcasting than it would elsewhere.

shipsass,"A proxy on a company network often has the opposite purpose of a VPN. If you're at the office, on your company computer, going to a secure site, that traffic is received at the proxy gateway, where the encryption is removed and the content inspected, before being re-encrypted and passed along to you. It's similar to the way TSA agents have a key for the lock on your suitcase. 

I'm responsible for network security at my company. I need to make sure there's no harmful content coming down the wire to the users' computers, so I have my security software suite look inside HTTPS connections to scan them. I don't use this power to read anyone's Reddit posts or anything else private. But there are no secrets from the proxy.

(Note: Some websites will not work behind a proxy. They recognize when the encryption has been broken in the middle of the connection and (as Chuck says above) they kill the traffic. If there's a valid and trustworthy reason for this, I allow the exception.)

A proxy, like Alex said on the show, can also allow you to make your Internet traffic appear like it's coming from somewhere else. For example, if you want to watch a show that is only available in the UK, you can pay for a service that routes your traffic through a proxy in the UK, and the server only sees your UK address.

You can also do location masking with a VPN service. The VPN, however, is locking down all traffic between you and the gateway. The proxy makes no such promises.

Unions do their own exploitation of workers to line the pockets of the union leadership. Unions exist to make their leadership rich, not to actually help workers.

DashSnowden,"Right, management decides whether it will ""recognize"" the union. In this case, management is saying, ""we will recognize the union, except that we will not recognize THIS union, because 30 of its 80 members are, in fact, management."" It's really complicated. Here is how the FLSA defines ""management"": 

&gt;Generally, ""management"" includes, but is not limited to, activities such as interviewing, selecting, and training of employees; setting and adjusting their rates of pay and hours of work; directing the work of employees; maintaining production or sales records for use in supervision or control; appraising employees’ productivity and efficiency for the purpose of recommending promotions or other changes in status; handling employee complaints and grievances; disciplining employees; planning the work; determining the techniques to be used; apportioning the work among the employees; determining the type of materials, supplies, machinery, equipment or tools to be used or merchandise to be bought, stocked and sold; controlling the flow and distribution of materials or merchandise and supplies; providing for the safety and security of the employees or the property; planning and controlling the budget; and monitoring or implementing legal compliance measures

It's even more vague than it sounds, though and based on what I know about Gimlet's operations, the mgmt-designated employees really might met the threshold.

DashSnowden,"Every bargaining unit comes to the table with a unique set of demands. In the case of the Gimlet Union, the one that stood out to me was the IP rights. Like, if you recall the Gimlet podcast ""Mystery Show,"" the creator/host was the creative catalyst and driving engine to the extent that Gimlet (probably) couldn't make the show without her. That podcast was one of Gimlet's early successes, as I recall the host did a good amount of press in which she inflated Gimlet's brand equity. But she was let go because ownership was unhappy with her performance. That's life. If the host owned her IP, she would have been able to shop ""Mystery Show"" to another network or even self-produce it. But (I'm guessing) Gimlet owns the IP, and the contract language probably prohibits the host from even doing a podcast that RESEMBLES ""Mystery Show."" Also she probably can't sell one of her ""Mystery Show"" stories to be adapted as a book or movie. Contract law is complicated, as are work-for-hire regulations, and the paperwork signed by employees upon taking a job tends to include some fairly restrictive (but abstract) terms. Anyway I don't know much about Gimlet specifically but everything I said above would be boilerplate in this industry. However I can't recall WGAE representing any podcast networks and they barely have any experience with online media (they represent like TV writers, but their jurisdiction expanded because of the growth of TV streaming). 

Long story short: among other things, this union would help to clarify IP in advance so that current and future Gimlet employees would not be in the position of the ""Mystery Show"" host (or at least would know in advance what position they would be in).

Management CAN'T organize with labor. However, there are certain standards that have to be met. The FLSA defines ""mgmt"" as making a certain amount of money, operating with a certain amount of autonomy, and being tasked with a certain range of responsibilities. If you are designated as ""mgmt"" by the FLSA you are ineligible for overtime pay among other things. That said, I BELIEVE the mgmt designation must meet a higher threshold to apply to union eligibility, which includes hiring/firing discretion. Precedent in this case would seem to favor the union.

DashSnowden,"The BIG takeaway here is: Alex and Matt are demanding a recount, but barring from the bargaining unit 30 of Gimlet's 80 employees. 

The 30 employees being barred from the bargaining unit are front-facing or high-level talent (hosts and editors, etc.) who will be designated as mgmt and ineligible from the union effort.

Whether or not the union moves forward after this is an afterthought. The bargaining unit has now been cut by 40% and leeched of all its most valuable resources. The remaining bargaining unit will be Gimlet's lowest-tiered and/or least-valuable and/or most-fungible assets. 

Segregating the company's employees into two distinct castes would create a toxic work environment, and I'd bet Alex and Matt are proceeding with some confidence that the remaining bargaining unit will not vote to ratify a union.

I work in online media and am VERY familiar with both the FLSA and WGA East, and I can say with some confidence that the Gimlet Union will survive ONLY if the bargaining unit is not split (and also: the newly ""mgmt""-certified employees have the most to lose if that occurs).",1553828186,gimlet

Proxies vs VPNs

* Both of these things are like relays for your internet traffic.
* VPNs create an encrypted connection between your computer and the VPN service, they encase all of your network if you set them up correctly (in fact, most people have a fail over switch that kills traffic so it doesn't leak)
* Proxies are also used in big organizations like universities and companies to store local copies of data to make requests faster.

Servers vs Hosts

* Every device that connects to a network is called a Host, but not every host is a server.  Any host could be a server if it's running server software, but for the most part they are specialized machines and run specialized software.

Why you might need a Tor bridge

* Bridges are a circumvention method, if you're internet service provider is blocking Tor or maybe your local government is, since the list of Tor bridges isn't public and many are secret to different groups, you can use it as a hop between your network and Tor so your local network can't tell what's going on.",1553792143,gimlet
decentwriter,"I know you already got the best answer possible here, but I did also just want to hop in as another podcast producer (not for this show, but another big show you almost definitely know of) and say that we hear this all the time too, especially at the beginning of the year. The in depth stories take minimum of six months, and sometimes a year, and if it's a story that requires a freelance reporter, working with their schedule is sometimes a logistical nightmare too. At my show specifically, all of our GOOD episodes are slated for the summer because when we sit down to budget out shows at the end of the year, we want to give them ample time to make the GOOD shows, so we front load the show at the beginning of the year with re-runs, easy softball shows that just help us cross the finish line each week, while the projects that take a lot of manpower, deep research and reporting, frickin cool sound design, and legal review are still in the works. I'd say, in general, if your favorite podcast has a couple of these easier to pull off shows for a few weeks, it's probably because they're focused on dropping something really fucking cool in the near future.

I'll skip to point (3) - Yea, Matt and Alex made a lot of money, but they also took a huge risk. Alex quit a secure job to start his own company. He skipped his paycheck, his health insurance, etc to start this company. Him and Matt (I assume) pay for all of the studio time, recording equipment, and other costs associated with podcasting. They negotiate deals with advertisers. All of this to say - if you look at all of their contributions to business, and everything they've done to get here, they don't look like scrooge.

Jumping back to point (2) - A lot of the posters I'm discussing this with (not you; you made an intelligent post) aren't really making a good argument for why a union is necessary. You can create a great work environment without a union. Are any of the companies on the [2019 Great Place to Work](https://www.greatplacetowork.com/best-workplaces/100-best/2019) (for those unaware - getting on this list takes a lot of work from employers; it's not some random list thrown together by a blogger) list unionized? I'm a big believer in worker's rights, and I think unions can help in some situations, but I'm just not understanding the need. Are Gimlet staffers working unhealthy hours right now? Are they not being compensated for their work? Is there abuse or unfair treatment in the work place?

I read this a while ago but it said that people that don't conform to the way the economy works, move to a place that thinks the way they do. In this case individualistic people moving out of scandinavia helped shape the policies that allow for unions to have power. Maybe the average swedish executive that moves to USA is more individualistic and prefers less union-friendly states because they think like they do.

IMO Gimlet is too late for a union now that they have just been acquired. Sucks for everyone but the people getting the checks but they should've moved quicker.

wizard_oil,"White-collar unions seem to be becoming more of a thing now -- one of the most prominent is the Writers Guild, which the Gimlet unionizers want to ally with. Also it seems the Gimlet union would cover more than just hosts, who are identified with their work and can carry listeners with them -- it would include people whose names we don't know offhand but who have contributed.

Why Gimlet in particular is getting hate:

(1) A lot of people view them as a progressive/left-leaning company run by Brooklyn media-hipster types. Not recognizing the union clashes with that image.

(On a surface level, they have been liberal-ish... but the moment they took VC money, they also had to become ruthless capitalists, so this move is not surprising to me personally.)  

(2) People have emotional investment in Gimlet due to the early seasons of Start Up.  We listened behind-the-scenes as the whole company formed. As a result Matt Lieber and Alex Blumberg are not like the faceless CEOs at Wondery or Stitcher, or wherever. So if you are pro-union, this whole thing just seems much more personal and disappointing.

Publish employee salaries

It's not always good.  Unions can also impede good workers for being rewarded.  Because there are often specified pay schedules, employers will often just stick to them, instead of rewarding people who do better work.  

Things like seniority policies can end up meaning that the new guy gets laid off, instead of the worst performer being laid off.  

Unions can also have a tendency to make workers lazy, because they know it is difficult to be fired or rewarded.  So there is limited incentive to work hard.

These sorts of things can make it harder for a business to operate.

doryphorus99,"I'm not sure how much Spotify is figuring into this, but if it is:   
I used to work with Swedish companies (like Spotify) doing business in the U.S., helping their executives establish offices, acquire companies. What always struck me was their approach to union vs non-union labor in Sweden as compared to the U.S. 

Sweden is a highly unionized workforce, covering the majority of its workers, blue- and white-collar. Workers' rights are sacrosanct there, and generally industry groups must negotiate with unions over all kinds of workplace minutiae. Coming the U.S., however, Swedish executives home right in on the less union-friendly states, the places with right to work laws and generally weaker unions. 

While that IS the approach I would expect from corporations protecting themselves from risk and cost, my suspicion is that is not an approach that would play well with their folks back home in Sweden. If Gimlet's new union raised some awareness in Sweden that Spotify was seemingly involved in squashing a union, well...

https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-46505722

With its surreal memes and creepy stories that blur fact and fiction, the subculture of teenage messaging boards is easy for adults to misinterpret. It is possible that journalists and concerned parents accessed these groups and brought together disparate elements into a story that wasn't really there.
That reading tallies with the findings of Alexandra Arkhipova, a professor in Folklore Studies at the Russian State University for the Humanities. When she and her colleagues entered the online groups alleged to be connected with the Blue Whale challenge, they found something strange.
""All of these 'curators',"" says Arkhipova, ""turned out to be children aged 12 to 14.""
Far from being manipulative adults, all the curators seemed to be just kids who had read or heard about the game. In fact, Arkhipova's research suggests that the ""challenge"" might not have really existed in any substantial way before the Novaya Gazeta article was published.
Arkhipova says that the ""curators"" she came across online were copycats, acting out step by step the parts of a game that was being widely reported in the press.
""In all these groups people, mainly young people, were waiting for this game,"" says Arkhipova. ""This game never starts.""
Prisoner
But where does that leave the story of Philipp Budeikin, the man who confessed to creating the game? Oddly, it might have something to do with his music career.
Friends of Budeikin, speaking to the investigative journalist Evgeny Berg, disputed the claim that he is an evil mastermind.
In fact, they say that he filled online groups with ""shock"" content related to Rina Palenkova and suicide in order to get as many followers as possible - and then advertise his music.
It is a common practice on VKontakte, where people exploit access to a large amount of followers to advertise other projects or sell products.
When Budeikin was arrested, there were 15 charges against him. By the following month, all but one had collapsed.
The truth at the heart of the Blue Whale challenge is surely both more sad and more mundane than the breathless articles might have us believe. Russia's suicide rates are high especially among the young. It has one of the highest rates of adolescent suicide in the world.
Yes, some teenagers appear to have been drawn into online forums where suicide was being discussed. And in those forums, blue whale memes were being shared. But the idea of a sinister game, one that slowly roped in vulnerable teens and led them down an increasingly tortured path to suicide, seems to be a simplistic explanation for a complex problem.",1553588315,gimlet

acu2005,"&gt;Ok so if I understand correctly you’re saying that if the company and the union are going to sit at the negotiation table the company has to first recognize the union?

I think it's possible that works that way but I could be completely wrong. Someone below said that legally the company has to negotiate since the employees all agreed to unionize but I in my mind it's possible the company not recognizing the union is just a stall tactic in the pre negotiation phase.

&gt;But if the union wants its demands met they can just go on strike until the company starts to talk?

This is where I'm pretty sure they can't but it would depend on labor laws. Gimlet would have an attendance policy in place since they're still pre contract negotiations and I'm willing to bet striking would violate those policy's. New York where I think gimlet is located is an at will employment state so Gimlet could probably fire anyone that strikes before negotiations even hit the table.
